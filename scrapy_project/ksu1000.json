Advisors assist you in identifying and achieving your academic, career, and personal\n                                    goals. They provide academic guidance in order to keep you on track for graduation\n                                    and can help connect you to campus programs and services. You are assigned an academic\n                                    advisor, or advising center, based on your intended major. We encourage you to meet with your advisor at least once each semester. Advising is\n                                    not registration! You should meet with your advisor prior to the date you register\n                                    for classes so you can discuss the best plan for the upcoming semester and beyond. How do I find out who my advisor is? How do I know when it\u2019s time to register each semester? How do I change my major? What classes are required for my major? Each major has a specific list of required classes for graduation. Current KSU students\n                                                   should check DegreeWorks for this list. DegreeWorks is a web-based tool through Banner Web that provides real-time information\n                                                   on degree progression. DegreeWorks lists the courses you are required to take to complete\n                                                   your degree at KSU. This is available to you 24/7. Login to  Owl Express  (enter your KSU ID & Pin) Select the Student menu. Select DegreeWorks \u2013 Degree Audit. Your declared major worksheet will automatically load. There is also a \u201cWHAT-IF\u201d tab that gives you an unofficial view of how your credits will apply to a different major. (NOTE: If you officially change your major, you will be moved to the most recent Catalog regardless of when you started classes at KSU.) DegreeWorks does not replace face to face advising. You should continue to meet with\n                                                   your advisor to discuss degree-related concerns.

Possessing computer skills and feeling comfortable online does not necessarily ensure\n                                    your success in an online course. A common theme in online courses is self-discipline\n                                    and persistence. At Kennesaw State, we are committed to helping our online students\n                                    achieving their academic best. What are the benefits of online learning? Online learning provides considerable freedom, allowing students to often choose when and where they'll participate in class activities.\u00a0 Students will have the same kinds of deadlines and structured responsibilities of\n                                                   a face-to-face class. In other words, flexibility must be balanced by responsibility.\n                                                   Like a face-to-face course, online courses require assignments be completed by due\n                                                   dates, your attendance (via logins to your course), involvement in online discussions,\n                                                   and sometimes group collaboration. Most students enjoy the active learning that online\n                                                   classes involve. What are the challenges of online learning? Self-motivation and discipline are required to succeed in distance learning courses.\n                                                   For many, distance learning offers access to education not previously available. It\n                                                   also provides a solution to flexibility needs, work and travel responsibilities, and\n                                                   family challenges. A successful experience in distance learning requires a basic familiarity with technology. Resources are available for students through University Information Technology Services for those interested in distance learning, but in need of a technology refresher. It is also strongly recommended that students have ready access to a computer or laptop with a high-speed Internet access, such as DSL or cable broadband. Online courses will require students to download and access course materials. Online learning success depends on preparation, motivation, dedication, and planning.\u00a0 What equipment and technology will I need to be successful at online learning?\u00a0 Online learners will need a computer, Internet access, basic software (such as Microsoft\n                                                   Office Suite, Windows Media Player, Quicktime movie player, anti-virus protection\n                                                   and a compatible browser), and auxiliary equipment (such as a webcam and microphone\n                                                   headset for video-based communication). Of course, technology needs will vary by course.\n                                                   But this list applies to the majority of courses. \u00a0 HAVE MORE QUESTIONS?

The Know More,\n                     Borrow Less (KMBL) initiative supports the USG\u2019s three primary objectives: graduate\n                     more students, be more affordable and be more efficient. This initiative is designed\n                     to reduce barriers to aid, improve students\u2019 understanding of borrowing and reduce\n                     student debt. To support this initiative, a \u201cdebt letter\u201d will be electronically sent in a mobile-friendly\n                     format to every enrolled student who currently has student loan debt resulting from\n                     federal or state loan programs, or private lender borrowing. Students will receive\n                     both a text and an email providing them a link to a personalized letter containing\n                     specific information on monthly payments based on their current loan amounts. Each\n                     academic year, students will receive a debt letter, updating them on their cumulative\n                     student loan debt.

Our\n                        goal is to make a positive impact on the lives of others through computing. We do\n                        that through education, research, engagement with industry, and active community outreach.\n                        We want computing to empower people and use it for social good. Over the last four decades, I have been fortunate to see the development and adoption\n                        of innovative technology into mainstream society. We can hardly imagine living a day\n                        without the Internet, smartphones, or (for some of you) video games. There is an ever-increasing\n                        demand for professionals as computing is a continuously evolving discipline \u2013 and\n                        it is one that is just as exciting and life changing today as in the past. To that end, our college offers high-quality academic programs in Computer Science,\n                     Applied Statistics, Data Science and Analytics, Software Engineering, Information\n                     Technology, and Game Design and Development at the undergraduate, masters and doctoral\n                     levels.

If you are a new student, thank you for choosing us! I would ask that you learn everything\n                     you can while you are here and, importantly, engage with us. We have an amazing number\n                     of opportunities for you, such as working with our industry partners or conducting\n                     research with our faculty.

Working in the laboratory of assistant professor\n                     of chemistry Graham Collier, Charland-Martin discovered a substance that made polymer\n                     materials degradable while retaining properties effective for electronic applications,\n                     such as solar cells or thin films for sunglasses. \u201cPolymers currently available are usually not reusable or recyclable, or they\u2019re made through less eco-friendly methods,\u201d said Charland-Martin, an  Honors  student in the  Double Owl  program who is also pursuing a master\u2019s degree in  chemical sciences . \u201cBy designing these polymers with a degradable building block, we can maintain their effectiveness and make them more environmentally adaptable.\u201d Charland-Martin\u2019s research followed the path of other studies in Collier\u2019s lab, which are aimed at simplifying the process of making polymers for electronic and light-related applications. In the spring, the College of Science and Mathematics selected 10 students to each receive a $4,000 stipend to pursue research during a summer program established by Birla Carbon, a worldwide chemical manufacturer.\u00a0 The 10 scholars were chosen based on the recommendations of faculty members, submission\n                     of an undergraduate research project abstract, and a GPA of 3.0 or higher. Recipients\n                     worked with their sponsoring faculty members on their proposed research projects in\n                     six departments within CSM. This year\u2019s scholars, their majors and their faculty mentors included: Since 2014, funds provided by Birla Carbon have enabled 93 Birla Carbon Scholars to\n                     participate in research. In 2019, Birla Carbon reaffirmed its pledge to the program\n                     by extending the agreement for another five years and adding $275,000 to the commitment.\n                     Terence Norman, director of human resources in the Americas at Birla Carbon, said\n                     the company looks forward to this event every year to showcase young scientists. \u201cJust when I think this symposium can\u2019t get any better, it exceeds my expectations,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI saw some truly impressive presentations here today, and I know the future is bright for these researchers. Congratulations to all the scholars. Your hard work is paying off.\u201d Along with the $4,000 stipend each scholar received, Charland-Martin received an additional $2,000 in travel funds to present her research at a national or regional conference.\u00a0 About Birla Carbon Birla Carbon is the world\u2019s largest producer and supplier of carbon black additives, which are used to make everything from tires to plastics, from paints to electronics.

She also plans to\n                     add 10 field study sites around the Atlanta area, including some sites in rural areas.\n                     With these new sites, Guindre-Parker and her team will involve local high school science\n                     students and teachers in soil sampling and other aspects of the research.\n                      \n                   \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to visit nearby schools and teach them a little bit about the work we do and teach them about heavy metals \u2014 where they're found, what caused them to accumulate in the environment and what their effects are on birds and humans alike,\u201d she said. \u201cWe're hoping to also sample their schoolyards and make sure that their soils are safe for them. So, I think that's another exciting part of the grant that will tie in nicely to the research and the student training.\u201d Guindre-Parker said Kennesaw State\u2019s location on a border between urban and rural areas makes it ideal for this research, and for her  research into starlings overall . She noted that KSU draws students from both urban and rural settings interested\n                     in in this research, and several professors and researchers in the  College of Science and Mathematics  study the effects of urbanization on the environment. \u201cKSU is well-situated to tackle this type of question and to be a front-runner on the topic of urbanization research,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s cool because it also spans our student population, so it can draw more people into the type of research that we\u2019re doing. Everyone can find something interesting or relevant to their lives in that type of research.\u201d The grant began Aug. 1 and funding runs through July 31, 2025. \u2013 Dave Shelles Photos by Jason Getz Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State adding program to diversify biomedical sciences A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content Saint-Louis's undergraduate experience at Kennesaw State prepared him to return as faculty member A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Breedlove, a junior  computer science  major in the  College of Computing and Software Engineering   (CCSE),  will live in Orlando for three months and work as a software engineering intern with\n                        Walt Disney Attractions Technology. \n                         April Breedlove \n                         \u201cI\u2019m going to be living out my dream,\u201d said Breedlove, who transferred to Kennesaw State this fall after graduating high school early. An experience in Disney World three years ago shaped that dream and changed the trajectory of her life. In 2019, Breedlove was one of 100 high school students nationwide accepted into the\n                        exclusive Disney Dreamers Academy (DDA). The four-day, all-expenses-paid trip introduces\n                        students from underrepresented communities to all the opportunities Disney provides\n                        through career workshops and mentoring sessions.  \u201cI thought there was no way I would get in,\u201d Breedlove said, after her first application was denied. \u201cBut growing up, my mom always said, \u2018Never let fear stop you from doing what you want, because you don\u2019t know what you could be missing.\u2019 I\u2019m so glad I followed that advice and applied again.\u201d At DDA, Breedlove joined the technology Deep Dive, a personalized small group based on participants\u2019 career interests, where she worked on Disney\u2019s Magic Bands. The w aterproof wristbands\u00a0allow guests to unlock their hotel room, enter theme parks, pay for food and much more by tapping the band to a touch point sensor. \u00a0 \u201cPrior to my experience in the Disney Dreamers Academy, I didn\u2019t know that Disney needed software engineers,\u201d \u00a0she added. \u201cI left that Deep Dive knowing I wanted to return.\u201d  Two years after DDA, Breedlove was rushing to class on Kennesaw State\u2019s Marietta campus when she saw a booth set up for the student organization Girls Who Code. Students at the booth said they were hosting a career fair and a recruiter from Disney was going to be there. \u00a0Breedlove attended the career fair and eagerly put together her Disney Professional Internship application. A few weeks later, she received a call from a recruiter. \u201cShe told me they wanted me to join the team as a software engineering intern and I started crying,\u201d Breedlove recalls. \u201cThis has been my dream since high school, but little did I know there would be more.\u201d \u00a0 \n                         As she wrapped her mind around starting her dream internship, Breedlove was surprised\n                        to get an email from DDA staff asking her to return to the Academy and mentor the\n                        newest group of high school students.  \u201cI wanted to have an individual impact on every student in my group,\u201d Breedlove said after she returned to campus. \u201cI really focused on making those connections, because connections at DDA and KSU are what helped get me to this point.\u201d \u00a0 When she returns to Orlando this summer, she will intern with the same team that inspired\n                        her three years ago. \u00a0 \u201cThat Deep Dive in high school sparked everything for me,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the speakers called it a \u2018destiny moment\u2019 where you realize what you want to do and what you want to be. I\u2019m looking forward to more of those moments this summer.\u201d \u00a0 \u2013 Abbey O\u2019Brien Barrows Photos by Judy Pishnery Making Their Mark: Newest KSU alumni are ready for the world Spring 2022 Commencement Kennesaw State student presenting research to Capitol Hill officials Kennesaw State students use technology to connect young adults with mentors A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Students are\n                     selected based on a review by a panel of experts in their field. Pursuing a  master\u2019s in applied statistics and analytics  in the  School of Data Science and Analytics , Jones\u2019 undergraduate research was conducted with input from his faculty mentor Susan Hardy, senior lecturer of statistics. Jones explores the differences in academic outcomes, debt accumulation and school-type of post-secondary schools with either a majority or minority proportion of students receiving a Pell Grant. \u201cMy message to legislators and even school officials is that incoming freshmen need to know what it means to be financially dependent on their parents versus independent and how to correct if they are misclassified,\u201d Jones said. \u201cDependent student loan debt is more than double that of independent students.\u201d Even before Posters on the Hill, Jones has received interest in his research from members of Congress. Rep. Lucy McBath\u2019s legislative aide, Matthew Golden, is taking the idea of instituting Pell Grant safeguards to committee. This week Jones has meetings scheduled with Sen. Jon Ossoff, Rep. Barry Loudermilk and Rep. Sanford Bishop. Jones was also one of five Kennesaw State students who  presented research projects  to state legislators and other officials at the Georgia Capitol as part of the Posters\n                     at the Georgia Capitol event on March 30.

Often this happens when you have transfer\n                              credit that meets the prerequisite or if there has been a course substitution, but\n                              there can be other reasons.

Find the Pok\u00e9mon: The Importance of Algorithms  (Grades 5-9)\u00a0 In this video, we learn about the importance of algorithms and choosing\n                     the right algorithm for a given task by playing a \"Find the Pok\u00e9mon Game.\" Along the\n                     way we meet Bill and Gina, school kids who play along with us. We discover two different\n                     algorithms for finding a hidden Pok\u00e9mon and learn when to choose one over the other.\n                     This video can be played online or downloaded. Handout, game sheets, and transcript\n                     are included.\u00a0 18 minutes.  Best Practices for Academic Success  (Grades 9-college) In this eight-minute video, Dr. Brown recalls the advice he gave\n                     students in his classes about note-taking and studying.\u00a0 Transcript and slides are\n                     available with the video.  Introduction to Binary Numbers  (Grades 3-5) Students make their own binary counting cards, then learn to manipulate\n                     binary numbers following instructions in a video.\u00a0This video can be played online\n                     or downloaded. Handout, printable counting cards, and transcript are included. 13\n                     minutes.

For dates, please see his   availability calendar . These presentations are geared toward middle school and high school students, but\n                     can be adapted for other audiences, including elementary school students. \u00a0 Contact Bob at  Bob.Brown@Kennesaw.edu   for details or to schedule a presentation or get my  vCard  or  public key . \u00a0 Bob is a  Raspberry Pi Certified Educator . Algorithms and searching:  This is a single 50-minute presentation based on the Battleships activity from  CS Unplugged , revised to use Pok\u00e9mon instead of battleships.\u00a0 Students work in pairs to locate\n                     each other's Pok\u00e9mon, first performing a linear search, then a binary search, and,\n                     time permitting, a hashed search.\u00a0 The concept of  algorithm  is introduced and formally defined.\u00a0 Students learn that some algorithms are more\n                     efficient than others, and Big-O notation is introduced briefly.\u00a0 The lesson concludes\n                     with a discussion of the importance of selecting the correct algorithm.\u00a0 Curriculum\n                     elements include comparing numbers for equality and inequality, coordinates, algorithms,\n                     efficiency of algorithms, and searching. Binary numbers: \u00a0 This is a single presentation of about 50-minutes that introduces binary numbers.\n                     It was designed for grades 6-10, but has been presented successfully to third-graders.\n                     The session outline and objectives are included in the \u00a0 teacher notes . If I present this, I will furnish a set of binary counting cards for each student,\n                     but we ask schools to duplicate the handout. I have fun presenting this, and I hope\n                     you'll invite me to do so, but I've packaged it into a \u00a0 teachers' kit \u00a0 that will let teachers present it independently with minimal pre-work. Boolean Logic: Kat's Cat Checker: \u00a0 This is the logic-only part of the Digital Logic series, condensed to a one-period\n                     presentation.\u00a0 Katherine, Kat for short, is headed to Hogwarts, and uses logic to\n                     specify the ideal cat to take with her.\u00a0 This may be best suited to grades 8 to 12. Careers in computing: \u00a0 This is a 15- to 50-minute presentation, depending on the time available, in which\n                     I discuss a number of careers in the computing field and end by suggesting that students\n                     also consider becoming a college professor. \u00a0Coding fundamentals with Python: \u00a0 This one is under development at a middle school; help me work on it. I'm working\n                     on a presentation of about eight or nine contact hours.\u00a0 I'm looking for another school\n                     to work with me. Cryptography, introduction: \u00a0 A single 50-minute session that introduces substitution and transposition ciphers,\n                     beginning with the C\u00e6sar Cipher. Students decrypt a message encrypted with the rail-fence\n                     cipher, then create a keyword substitution cipher.\u00a0 The presentation is available\n                     as a  narrated-slide video .\u00a0 The accompanying  handout is available as a PDF . Cryptography, public key: \u00a0 A single 50-minute presentation that demonstrates the workings of modern public key\n                     cryptography, including digital signatures. This one is all lecture, with no classroom\n                     activities, and so is best suited to grades 10-12. There is a take-home exercise in\n                     which students generate their own public/private key pair. Cryptography exercises: \u00a0 These are optional exercises for students who want to go beyond the exercises in\n                     the handouts.\u00a0 The exercises cover the Vigen\u00e8re cipher, the one-time pad, and public\n                     key cryptography. Digital logic:   I've presented this several times with refinements after each.\u00a0 It shows students\n                     that there's no magic in computers. There is an outline and objectives document available;\n                     I am very willing to adapt it to your curriculum. Handouts for all three days are\n                     available to download, and there's a video of day 3.\u00a0 Students need a basic understanding\n                     of binary numbers. This might fit best in grades 8 to 12.\u00a0 This requires the free\n                     software package Digital Works.\u00a0 If installation of software is a problem, I can bring\n                     copies for each student on CD. Information Security : \u00a0 This is a series of three presentations with a target audience of grades 7-10. It\n                     is probably best to do these once a week or every other week for three or six weeks\n                     rather than all at once. The three sessions are Information Security Fundamentals,\n                     Encryption, and Threat Analysis. There is more detail in the outline and objectives. \u00a0 Micro:Bit: \u00a0  This is a series of eight 50-minute sessions in which students learn the fundamentals\n                     of programming using the Micro:Bit device. Programming differs from \"coding\" in depth\n                     and breadth. Students learn \"coding\" and also some of the science behind software\n                     development. Raspberry Pi :  What we can do depends on the school's objective, the equipment available, and the\n                     time available.\u00a0 If you have Raspberry Pi equipment, I can help your teachers get\n                     ready to use it in the curriculum.\u00a0 I can work directly with students to get them\n                     started building Raspberry Pi projects.\u00a0 I can help your school start a  Code Club  and provide some assistance in the operation of the club.\u00a0 If the Raspberry Pi is\n                     new to you, it's a $45 computer that can be used for making physical projects.\u00a0 The\n                     $45 is for a bare computer; you will end up spending $80-200 per pair of students\n                     to equip a Raspberry Pi lab.\u00a0 I've prepared an  annotated shopping list  to help you get started. The  Raspberry Pi Foundation  has more details.   Sphero SPRX:  I'm working with a middle school to teach block programming to sixth graders using\n                     the Sphero environment.\u00a0 The program will be eight or nine lessons, and I'm looking\n                     for a second school to work with me. I am very willing to prepare new material to suit your needs or curriculum. Contact\n                     me and we can probably work something out.\u00a0 I'm also available to help with curriculum\n                     development, professional development, and the development of learning objects.\u00a0 Contact\n                     me at  Bob.Brown@Kennesaw.edu  to work out the details.\u00a0 There is no fee for any presentation, but we do ask that schools duplicate any handout\n                     material that may be required. When I present at a school, a teacher must be present\n                     at all times and be responsible for classroom management. The presentations listed\n                     are designed for a room with a projector and a Windows computer that can show PowerPoint\n                     with video and sound.\u00a0 If you let me know, I can bring a suitable laptop with HDMI\n                     video and audio output.\u00a0 I can also present without audiovisual aids if you give me\n                     plenty of notice.

(Jul 2, 2020)  \u2014 Luis Cuevas has always considered himself to be a Disney fan. He spent his childhood watching all of the classic films and says his favorite book\n                     is The Ride of a Lifetime, a memoir written by longtime Walt Disney Company chief\n                     executive Bob Iger. So when he learned of Kennesaw State University\u2019s new Disney Interactive\n                     Entertainment Study Program, the journalism student leapt at the opportunity to apply\n                     his studies toward learning the magic behind a company he has long admired. \u201cI knew that gaining an insider\u2019s perspective on how an industry leader works was\n                     going to be a key takeaway for me,\u201d Cuevas said. \u201cThinking through how a brand like\n                     Disney continues to grow and adapt was something that has always inspired me, and\n                     this course was exactly what I needed to challenge my creativity.\u201d Cuevas was one of nearly 30 students who recently took part in the program offered\n                     by the Joel A. Katz Music and Entertainment Business Program (MEBUS) and the College\n                     of Computing and Software Engineering (CCSE). Conceived as an affordable \u201cstudy away\u201d\n                     option, the four-week program is designed to give students a deep dive on how Disney\n                     and its many properties continue to pioneer world-changing entertainment technology.\n                     In its original format, students would study on campus for three weeks and spend one\n                     week at Walt Disney World to learn how the company applies the technology in its theme\n                     parks to generate unforgettable experiences. As part of the program, students were allowed to choose from four courses with topics\n                     including 3D modeling and animation, and entertainment media production. While the\n                     coronavirus pandemic ultimately prevented students from visiting the parks this year,\n                     CCSE Dean Jon Preston said the program stayed the course by offering students an interdisciplinary\n                     approach to studying the Disney creative process, albeit remotely. \u201cOne of the core elements of this program \u2013 whether it was from a video production,\n                     creative adaptability, 3D graphics or animation standpoint \u2013 was looking at best practices\n                     for Disney and studying the kinds of experiences they are known to create,\u201d he said.\n                     \u201cWe still hung on to that Disney approach to excellence in the courses, which was\n                     paramount for our students.\u201d Keith Perissi, MEBUS director and senior lecturer of music entertainment, said the\n                     program is the result of a longtime collaboration between MEBUS and CCSE. Though they\n                     are different courses of study at Kennesaw State, he said students representing the\n                     two are able to bond over a common language: technology.    \u201cWhen you mix those two worlds together, it\u2019s like magic,\u201d Perissi said. \u201cI\u2019m proud\n                     of our students for being able to pivot and make this a really unique experience.\u201d Perhaps no course made the pivot easier than one in creative adaptability, he added.\n                     The course is designed to help students understand the business of creativity by giving\n                     them hands-on experiences in project building. For the Disney Interactive Entertainment\n                     Study Program, this meant learning how Disney was able to work through its own creative\n                     process to adapt to the onset of COVID-19. Midway through the course, students were treated to a live video call with Dan Cockerell,\n                     a longtime Disney employee who most recently served as vice president of the Magic\n                     Kingdom Park. Cockerell shared with the class his own experiences within the Disney\n                     brand and imparted advice on harnessing the creative process. The course culminated with students taking Disney properties, such as Pixar, Lucas\n                     Films and Marvel, and generating pitches for how those properties could be repurposed\n                     into short films, feature films or television series under the constraints of the\n                     pandemic. \u201cThe course really taught me how to look at things from a different perspective and\n                     learn how to create under atypical circumstances,\u201d said Skylar Cleland, whose project\n                     focused on the backstory of Frozone from \"The Incredibles.\" \u201cIn a way, I think COVID-19\n                     enhanced this course and challenged us to think outside the box. It was memorable\n                     not only for the challenge it presented to me, but to also see how creative my classmates\n                     could be with their own projects, and I really hope to see them all come into fruition\n                     one day.\u201d Erin Lyles, a public relations student who chose to pitch a new Pixar short film that\n                     explores the colors of someone\u2019s aura, said the program has forever changed the way\n                     she approaches a project. \u201cMy final project was super impactful to me because I think I made it a lot more personal\n                     than I had intended to do,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helped me grow, and it is something that\n                     will always be on my mind until I make it a reality.\u201d Written by Travis Highfield Photos submitted Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

We have a no tolerance policy when it comes\n                              to discrimination or inequality.

We use that money to\n                              pay for all the fees that come along with renting space on campus (trash, staff, etc),\n                              sanitizing products, the shirt you will all receive, and also resources for you to\n                              utilize throughout the process. When can I move in and are my meals for the week provided?\u00a0 Early move-in is coordinated by KSU Housing. If you selected that you will require\n                              early move-in while registering, then your name will be given over to KSU Housing.\n                              Regularly check your student email to keep up with early move-in updates from KSU\n                              Housing. Potential New Members move in August 8th and the morning of Orientation (August\n                              9th). We ask that you please keep August 8th and August 9th open for your move-in.\n                              Dinner will be provided following Orientation. Lunch will be provided on Wednesday\n                              (KSU Commons), Thursday (KSU Commons) and Friday (Pizza). PNM's will be responsible\n                              for any additional meals during the remainder of the week.\u00a0 What do I need to be successful in Recruitment? 1. Be yourself! You want to join an organization that loves you for who you are, not\n                              what you are trying to be 2. Keep an open mind! You may go into recruitment thinking you know what chapter you\n                              want to join, but be open for that to change. Remember you have only seen a little\n                              bit of our organization, so treat each day as a new opportunity to find out more.\u00a0 3.This is your experience! It does not matter what your friends or family is telling\n                              you, do what makes you happy. If you were in a buffet line behind your friend and\n                              they put your least favorite food on their plate, would you do the same? Would you\n                              judge them for liking that food? No everyone has their own preferences.\u00a0 Recruitment Support FAQs What is a Pi Chi? A Pi Chi, also known as a recruitment counselor, is a sorority member who is disassociated\n                              from her chapter during Formal Recruitment to assist PNMs through the process. Each\n                              PNM is assigned two Pi Chis. You will be placed in your Pi Chi Group at the end of\n                              July!\u00a0 What if I don't get along with my Pi Chi? You will have a chance to meet several of the Pi Chis throughout this experience.\n                              \u00a0Your Pi Chi is there for you to feel comfortable with how you\u2019re feeling. \u00a0If you\n                              do not connect with one or both, utilize the opportunity to meet other Pi Chis as\n                              well as other participants in the process.\u00a0 Will there be any new initiatives this Recruitment to engage me in this process? This recruitment we will be hosting some fun activities at the end of each day. We\n                              understand you may be tired, which is why this will be very casual. We are currently\n                              looking at a movie night, bingo night, popscicle social and a preference party. We\n                              want you to be engaged in this experience and feel you can relaz after a long day. During Recruitment FAQs\u00a0 Will I have the opportunity to meet all of the organizations? Yes, you will have ample time to meet every organization in our Panhellenic community.\u00a0\n                              At Orientation you will meet all eight organizations in the Panhellenic Community.\n                              Then on the first day of recruitment you will see seven of our organizations who participate\n                              in recruitment.\u00a0 \u00a0 What should I talk about during Panhellenic recruitment events? It is important to be yourself. Let your conversations flow naturally and don\u2019t be\n                              afraid to ask questions. Take time to learn more about how each chapter develops their\n                              sisterhood, how they support their philanthropy(ies) and how they enhance the sister/alumnae\n                              experience. How do I get a good understanding of the chapter if I don't interact with everyone? During recruitment, regardless of the format, you do not always have the opportunity\n                              to meet every sister in each organization. \u00a0As a result, ask questions! \u00a0Use the time\n                              you have with the sisters you meet to learn more about their chapters and their unique\n                              experiences. \u00a0Potential New Members are always encouraged to ask sisters any questions\n                              they have about the chapter as a whole - so start thinking about these questions now\n                              to ensure you get them answered during recruitment.\u00a0 How will sororities invite me back if I've only talked a few people? You will be able to have genuine and real conversations with our sororities. Each\n                              chapter has their own way of deciding who they will be extending invitations. These\n                              decisions are based around the values that define their sisterhood. We will talk further\n                              about the mutual selection process at Orientation. What if I have trouble choosing a sorority? Difficult decisions are common, but do not look at this as a problem. Think about\n                              what each organization has to offer you and what you could potentially offer to the\n                              chapter. Focus on the chapter(s) where you felt the most comfortable and follow your\n                              intuition..\u00a0 Joining/Membership FAQs What are the requirements for membership? A Potential New Member (PNM) must be a currently enrolled KSU student. Note that each\n                              chapter may have a minimum GPA requirement. All PNMs must be registered and have paid\n                              the registration fee by the due date in order to join. What is a bid? A bid is an invitation to join a National Panhellenic Conference sorority. Bids are\n                              extended the last days of recruitment and you can only receive one. What if I\u2019m not happy with the bid I receive? \u00a0 Always remember that accepting a bid does not bind you to the chapter. You can choose\n                              to discontinue your New Member Process at any point before initiating. The majority\n                              of women who accept a bid from their second choice end up extremely happy in their\n                              chapter and choose to initiate. Each sorority is full of different types of women\n                              and many opportunities, meaning you can find your place in any one of them! If I go through Panhellenic recruitment, am I obligated to join? No. Women choose to participate in recruitment to meet people and spark new friendships.\n                              Panhellenic recruitment is an opportunity for you to meet sororities and decide if\n                              you\u2019d like to join the fraternity and sorority life community. Is there a minimum GPA requirement to receive a bid? In order to be a part of our community, potential members must have a minimum 2.5\n                              GPA. \u00a0This number is based off of an individual\u2019s most recent cumulative GPA, whether\n                              that is their high school GPA, transfer GPA, or Kennesaw State GPA. \u00a0It is important\n                              to note that the Department bases our GPA calculation in conjunction with Kennesaw\n                              State University, meaning for high school and transfer GPAs that only core, non-elective\n                              classes are counted. \u00a0For the Kennesaw GPA, the department utilizes the adjusted cumulative\n                              GPA for membership purposes. Additionally, while the above listed GPAs are the minimum requirements to receive\n                              an invitation of membership into an organization, having this GPA does not guarantee\n                              membership. \u00a0For many of our organizations, a new member must have a GPA that is at\n                              least equivalent to their organization\u2019s average GPA that is listed under the \u201cAbout\n                              Us \u2013 Academics\u201d section of the FSL website. \u00a0Due to this number constantly changing,\n                              other than publishing the minimum GPA for each council, the Department is unable to\n                              confirm the actual GPA needed to receive an invitation for membership into an individual\n                              organization. What if my parents/guardians do not approve of me joining? \u00a0 Sororities are so much more than people see in the media. There are many positives\n                              that come out of joining a sorority. You not only find members that support you but\n                              you raise money for your community and philanthropy, grow personally and in leadership\n                              experiences, and establish connections that can benefit you throughout and after college.\n                              We also know that members in our Panhellenic community have an overall higher GPA\n                              than members not in a sorority. So explain things like this to your parents and hopefully\n                              they will understand. Also remember this process is for you and all about you, so\n                              if joining a sorority will make you happy, do it! Post Recruitment Panhellenic Experience FAQs What are expectations of membership? When a student is extended an invitation to join a Sorority they become a new member.\n                              This is a period of learning about fraternity and sorority life prior to initiation.\n                              New Member Education Program is designed to teach the fundamentals of being an effective\n                              member of your sorority, so that the chapter can enjoy the future leadership of these\n                              members. The objectives of an effective New Member Education Program are: To assist and develop members to be outstanding members\u00a0 To develop members intellectually, spiritually, and socially/morally To familiarize new members with the Sorority - the organization and the people To demonstrate friendship and provide a conduit to build strong, lasting friendships To prepare new members to uphold the standards and ideals of your Sorority, and strive\n                              to continually improve it What are some things I will need to do as a New Member?

The end of the twentieth\n                        century gave birth to a new movement \u2013 that of multiculturalism.\u00a0Newly formed fraternities\n                        and sororities were looking to write a new page in the Greek-letter society history\n                        books. The message that they announced was the inclusiveness of all cultures, races,\n                        religions, and creeds. The Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) at Kennesaw State upholds the ideals of these\u00a0organizations,\n                        which include, inclusion, diversity, and acceptance of things outside the norm. The\n                        council consists of organizations that are part of diverse backgrounds and heritages.\n                        The purpose of MGC is to promote and foster positive interfraternal relations, communication,\n                        and development of all multicultural organizations through mutual respect, leadership,\n                        honesty, professionalism and education.\u00a0 The goals of our Multicultural Greek Council are: President: Leo Barranco ( ksumgcpresident@gmail.com ) Vice President of Internal Affairs: Zeke Lipscomb ( ksumgc.vpi@gmail.com ) Vice President of External Affairs: Eunice Cuffie ( ksumgc.vpe@gmail.com ) Treasurer: Jackeline Del Carmen ( ksumgc.treasurer@gmail.com ) Parliamentarian: Samantha Ballesteros ( ksumgc.parliamentarian@gmail.com ) Delta Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc.

Kennesaw State University\u2019s (KSU) Multicultural Greek Council is relatively new and\n                              growing! In addition, the council consists of students from diverse backgrounds with\n                              varying interests and beliefs. MGC also has a more intimate membership with chapters\n                              that are smaller in number. How many organizations make up Kennesaw State\u2019s Multicultural Greek Council? There are currently 5 fraternities and 3 sororities that make up Kennesaw State\u2019s\n                              Multicultural Greek Council. Although the council is made up of 8 organizations, it\n                              is continuously growing through MGC\u2019s Expansion process.\u00a0 Sororities: Delta Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. (Coming Fall 2022) Fraternities: Phi Iota Alpha Fraternity, Inc. Lambda Theta Phi Latin Fraternity, Inc. La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc. Sigma Beta Rho Fraternity, Inc. How much do you have to pay to join an MGC sorority or fraternity? Costs for joining an MGC organization vary by chapter. Membership fees can but may\n                              not be limited to local and national dues, chapter initiation materials, membership\n                              education supplies (books, information packets, etc), and member development costs.\n                              Depending on the chapter, one or more payments are paid directly to the sorority/fraternity.\n                              Most chapters offer payment plans for students, and scholarships may be available\n                              within the individual chapters as well. The University does not have a role in this\n                              process; the student deals directly with the chapter. It is important that the student\n                              asks questions so that they are able to understand how the money is being utilized. Do I need to be of a certain race/ethnicity to join MGC sororities/fraternities? No, MGC organizations are open and welcoming to all cultural backgrounds. An organization\n                              may have been historically founded to support and shape students from a particular\n                              ethnicity; however, it is not exclusive to only one cultural background. Each sorority\n                              and fraternity embraces and expresses multiculturalism in their own unique ways. What is \u201cintake\u201d/ \u201crush\u201d / \u201crecruitment\u201d? While each organization refers to it with different names, the Membership Intake/Rush/Recruitment\n                              process refers to the membership education process for potential new members or class.\n                              MGC chapters bring in either a new class or line through this process that is either\n                              \u2018open\u2019 (meaning public) or \u2018closed\u2019 (meaning private). Membership Intake/Rush/Recruitment\n                              includes a variety of activities including but not limited to interviews, bonding\n                              activities, and educational meetings about the history of the organization. For some\n                              organizations the end of Membership Intake/Rush/Recruitment process is celebrated\n                              with a new member presentation. It is important to ask about membership expectations\n                              as you seek membership in a MGC organization. Am I required to attend a certain event before I am considered for membership? YES! MGC hosts Meet MGC each semester that is required in order to join an Multicultural\n                              Greek Council Organization. MGC sororities and fraternities facilitate their own interest\n                              meetings. Thus, MGC does not require prospective members to attend an event (ie. MGC\n                              101 or Meet MGC) to be considered for membership. Interested students should attend\n                              official events hosted by the organization to be considered for membership and to\n                              begin the membership process.\u00a0 When does recruitment for the Multicultural Greek Council occur? The membership intake process for MGC organizations occurs during the Fall or Spring\n                              semester at the discretion of each organization. Most organizations host informational\n                              events where students can learn more information on how to prepare for intake/rush.\n                              Research and contact members of the specific chapter you are interested in joining\n                              to see when their events occur. All chapters promote these events on their individual\n                              chapter social media handles. View the \u201cMulticultural Greek Council\u201d tab on our website\n                              to be directed to the MGC Instagram Page, where each chapter\u2019s social media information\n                              is housed. What happens if I choose not to continue in an intake process once I\u2019ve started? You have no obligation to complete an intake process of any organization. If there\n                              are any difficulties in the process or additional concerns arise, please contact the\n                              chapter advisor or the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life. Will MGC sororities and fraternities accept new members during the COVID-19 pandemic? Each sorority and fraternity is advised to follow state and university guidelines\n                              as it relates to hosting recruiting events/meetings. At the discretion of each organization\n                              and its national headquarters, they may choose to host intake/rush during this time;\n                              however, the safety of all parties involved will be the organization\u2019s top priority. What if the organization I want to join is not currently recognized by KSU\u2019s Department\n                                    of Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL)? If the organization you wish to join is not recognized by FSL, then the organization\n                              is not accepting new members.\u00a0 I am interested in chartering a sorority or fraternity in MGC. How do I get started? The council conducts an annual vote to open for expansion. If/when the general body\n                              votes to open for expansion, an unrecognized organization can utilize the MGC Expansion\n                              Policy to be considered for recognition by FSL and MGC. The MGC views expansion as influencing the advancement of fraternity and sorority\n                              life at KSU as it provides options for non-members. Expansion also allows for the\n                              advancement of a widely growing movement of culturally-based organizations nationally\n                              to positively impact our community at KSU. The MGC will work with the Department of\n                              Fraternity and Sorority Life to consider expansion opportunities, while understanding\n                              the collective capacity of all involved in making successful expansion happen. We\n                              reserve the right to limit expansion at any time when reasonable efforts to support\n                              new groups cannot be made.

On May 10, 1930, on the campus of Howard University, in Washington DC, the National\n                     Pan-Hellenic Council was formed as a permanent organization with the stated purpose\n                     and mission:\n                   \u201cUnanimity of thought and action as far as possible in the conduct of Greek letter\n                           collegiate fraternities and sororities, and to consider problems of mutual interest\n                           to its member organizations.\u201d  Early in 1937, the organization was incorporated under the laws of the State of Illinois\n                     and became known as \u201cThe National Pan-Hellenic Council, Incorporated.\u201d Kennesaw State University is home to six (6) of the nine (9) organizations that fall\n                     under the governance of the National Pan-Hellenic Council. The chapters value academic\n                     excellence, community service, and strong sisterhood/brotherhood connections.  NPHC Convocation is hosted every semester, and is mandatory for any undergraduate\n                        student to attend that would like to join an NPHC organization. \u00a0 Frequently Asked Questions regarding NPHC What is NPHC? The National Pan-Hellenic Council, Inc. (NPHC) is the umbrella organization for the\n                     nine (9) historically African-African American fraternities and sororities. It was\n                     organized in May 1930 at Howard University in Washington D. C. The stated purpose\n                     of the organization as written in 1930 is, \u201cUnanimity of thought and action, as far\n                     as possible, in the conduct of Greek letter collegiate fraternities and sororities,\n                     and to consider problems of mutual interest to its member organizations.\u201d\n                   Membership in NPHC organizations extends beyond the college experience. Upon initiation,\n                     individuals accept a lifetime commitment to the goals and objectives of their respective\n                     organizations. Members develop many close bonds and friendships that are often unbreakable\n                     and maintained throughout their lives.\n                   Which NPHC organizations are active, and recognized by the Department of Fraternity\n                        and Sorority Life at Kennesaw State University? Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc.- Tau Zeta Chapter Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.- Pi Phi Chapter Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc- Omicron Iota Chapter Omega Psi Phi Fraternity, Inc.- Alpha Delta Nu Chapter Zeta Phi Beta Sorority, Inc.- Theta Rho Chapter Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.- Sigma Alpha Chapter Why should I join NPHC? You should join an NPHC organization if you are interested in a historically significant\n                     organization dedicated to serving their community and creating brotherhood/sisterhood.\n                     These organizations each have something that makes them special and it is up to you\n                     to find which one fits you best. Joining an NPHC represented organization is joining\n                     a brotherhood/sisterhood for life and is a lifetime commitment to serving the surrounding\n                     communities.\n                   How do I become a member of an NPHC organization? Recruitment and membership intake for the organizations of the National Pan-Hellenic\n                     Council may vary differently between each of the Divine Nine organizations. Those\n                     who are interested in learning more about these Divine Nine Fraternities and Sororities\n                     are encouraged to research the history of each organization, visit their National\n                     website, learn of their respective membership requirements, and develop a relationship\n                     with the chapter members of your organizational interest. To any extent beyond that,\n                     membership recruitment and intake is under full coordination of the specific chapter\n                     and their national organization. However, all membership intake processes must be\n                     conducted by a chapter that is both active with its national organization and recognized\n                     by the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life at Kennesaw State University.\n                   All students interested in joining a NPHC chapter at KSU, must attend NPHC Convocation.\n                     Convocation is hosted every semester by the Dept. of Fraternity and Sorority Life\n                     and the National Pan-Hellenic Council. More information for registering for Convocation,\n                     dates, and cost of attendance can be found at fsl.kennesaw.edu and the KSU NPHC Instagram\n                     page, @ksunphc.\n                   How much does it cost? The cost to join an NPHC organization varies from organization to organization, and\n                     the fees are subject to change at any time. Because these organization exist under\n                     a national umbrella, a significant portion of the funds go to the National organization,\n                     required conferences and conventions, local chapter dues, and other various items\n                     that may be needed for the membership intake process. Talk to the members of the organizations\n                     if you would like a better idea of how much they might cost.\n                   What are the requirements to become a member? The requirements vary from organizations to organization. Kennesaw State University\n                     requires students to have a least a 2.5 GPA, but some organizations requirements are\n                     higher than those. Students interested in joining an NPHC organization must complete\n                     12 credit hours prior to joining, but some organizations may have other credit requirements.\n                   It also helps to have prior leadership experience, and community service, as most\n                     organizations will want to see your resume to know that you will represent their organization\n                     well. It is also recommended that you attend the organizations programs and service\n                     projects to get to know them better, to increase the likelihood that they will select\n                     you for membership.\n                   If I am a legacy member, meaning my parents or close family members were a member\n                        of NPHC, am I automatically in? Being a legacy of any Greek organization does not automatically guarantee membership\n                     in any organization. Some organizations have special sections on membership intake\n                     paperwork where you can indicate whether you are a legacy or not, while others do\n                     not have policies regarding legacies. Often times, it is advised to proceed through\n                     programs and interest meetings/rush without a large amount of members knowing about\n                     your legacy status. Remember that discretion is important with NPHC intake, so please\n                     exercise that concept in multiple areas, including sharing information about legacy\n                     status.\n                   Do I have to be African-American to join? No. The NPHC, and each of its member organizations have non-discriminatory policies\n                     and practices. They are also actively involved in activities and programs designed\n                     to eradicate bias and discrimination in all phases of life. The formation of an NPHC\n                     council ensures that the philosophies of affiliate member organizations are maintained.\n                     It is important and highly recommended that NPHC councils seek to influence other\n                     organizations through its programming and activities.\n                   How do I express interest in joining an NPHC organization? The best way to express interest in joining an NPHC organization is by attending chapter\n                     programs, events, and community service projects. Each organization/chapter hosts\n                     a variety of educational, social, and philanthropic events on and off campus throughout\n                     the year, and by showing up and participating, you are letting them know you are interested\n                     in their organization. In addition, some organizations (not all) have interest/informational\n                     meetings that allow you to gain more knowledge about their organization/chapter, and\n                     express interest in their fraternity or sorority. Please follow the KSU NPHC Instagram\n                     page (@ksunphc) and NPHC chapter Instagram pages for more information about events.\n                   Does NPHC step? Some NPHC organizations do step and stroll, however stepping and strolling is a small\n                     portion of what we do, and should not be a major consideration when considering joining\n                     an organization.\n                   Alpha Phi Alpha Alpha Kappa Alpha Kappa Alpha Psi Omega Psi Phi Zeta Phi Beta Sigma Gamma Rho President - Savannah Gallimore ksunphcpresident@gmail.com 1st Vice President - Ayana Simon ksunphcvp@gmail.com 2nd Vice President - Prince Henderson ksunphcvp2@gmail.com Secretary - Serenity Hill ksunphcsec@gmail.com Treasurer - Ashley Edgar ksunphctreasurer1@gmail.com \u00a0\n                                     PR Coordinator - Ariel Johnson ksunphcpr@gmail.com Parliamentarian - Olivia Robinson ksunphcparliamentarian@gmail.com \u00a0 Each Fall and Spring Semester, the National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) hosts NPHC\n                              Convocation.

If you are a Georgia resident enrolling in a degree program at KSU, you may be eligible\n                     for the HOPE Scholarship. Recipients must demonstrate academic achievement to be considered\n                     for the HOPE Scholarship. If you recently graduated from high school, you can only be awarded after Georgia\n                     Student Finance Commission (GSFC) has evaluated your high school transcripts. After\n                     noting you are a HOPE Scholar, you may contact our office by email if not awarded\n                     HOPE at KSU.\u00a0You can view your HOPE GPA by logging into your account at  www.gafutures.org .

If you have a 3.00 GPA HOPE at one of these benchmarks,\n                     please contact our office. You may view your HOPE GPA calculation by logging into your account at  www.gafutures.org . The  GA Futures website  provides a guide and FAQ for tracking your HOPE/Zell Miller academic eligibility. If you think you may be eligible, you will need to complete the  Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)  or the  Georgia Scholarship/Grant Application (GSFAPPS) . To be eligible for the HOPE Scholarship, you must meet the following requirements: All students must maintain a 3.0 HOPE GPA at their 30, 60 and 90 attempted hours checkpoint\n                     and at the end of every Spring semester. Award amounts are determined annually by the Georgia Student Finance Commission.\u00a0To\n                     view the current award amounts, please visit  GSFC's website . The amount of a student's HOPE Scholarship is ultimately based on the number of credit\n                     hours in which a student is enrolled each semester, not to exceed payment for a maximum\n                     of 15 semester hours. The initial award amount assumes the maximum HOPE amount (15-hour\n                     rate) for which the student is eligible each semester. The HOPE award amount will\n                     be reduced when students enroll in fewer than 15 hours and will adjust at the time\n                     of disbursement of financial aid. The HOPE award amounts cannot be increased for students\n                     who enroll in more than 15 hours. Furthermore, the HOPE Award Amount cannot exceed\n                     the student's total tuition charges for the semester.

The U.S. Federal Government has many financial aid options to help offset the cost\n                     of an education. If you apply for financial aid, you may be offered loans as part\n                     of your school\u2019s financial aid offer. A loan is money you borrow and must pay back\n                     with interest. Students seeking financial aid should apply using the Free Application\n                     for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA determines eligibility for all Federal\n                     Aid, including (but not limited to): The State of Georgia has several financial assistance programs available to Georgia\n                     residents. A student must meet state eligibility requirements to receive state aid.\u00a0For\n                     more information please visit the  Georgia Futures- Hope and State Aid Programs website. Scholarships in Georgia include (but are not limited to): Scholarships are private monies that are made available to students from various local\n                     community groups, corporate donors, and the University.

KSU scholarships  include: Students are encouraged to research opportunities for external scholarships. KSU has\n                     launched an easy, mobile and personalized process that makes finding and applying\n                     for scholarships easier than ever. Our scholarship finder-  Scholarship Universe - will match you to your best fit opportunities! Many students work on- or off-campus during the school year. Several campus programs\n                     are available for students who want to work during their time in school. State programs and private donor-selected scholarships are also available and require\n                     students to apply separately.

Families facing severe financial problems due to job loss, medical expenses, foreclosure\n                     or business decline can request a review of their aid eligibility. This is called\n                     a Family Contribution Appeal and the form to request a review is located on  Owl Express . Circumstances that will be considered include: \u00a0- Loss of income because of recent unemployment \u00a0- High unreimbursed medical and/or dental expenses \u00a0-\u00a0Separation or divorce \u00a0- Death of a parent or spouse \u00a0- Cost of attendance Use of Professional Judgment:\u00a0\u00a0 Evaluation of financial aid applications are handled through a review process using\n                     professional judgment by financial aid professionals in the KSU Office of Scholarships\n                     and Financial Aid.\u00a0 Any request to our office is considered using best professional\n                     practices and making such a request does not guarantee approval. Financial aid regulations\n                     are subject to change through legislation or policy changes by the U.S. Department\n                     of Education. Timing of requests:\u00a0 All requests will be reviewed as they are received.\u00a0 You should allow a minimum of\n                     three weeks for your request to be reviewed. All requests for a Professional Judgment must be processed by June 15th for the current\n                     academic year, for example, for the 2021-2022 academic year requests must be processed\n                     by June 15, 2022.\u00a0 Requests received after the June 15th date will not be considered. The law governing Federal Student Aid (Title IV) categorizes students as \"dependent\"\n                     or \"independent\" based on the premise the student and parents have the primary responsibility\n                     for meeting the student's educational costs. This premise applies even when the parents\n                     are not actually supporting the student. The institution's financial aid administrator is given the statutory authority to\n                     exercise \"professional judgment\" and declare a dependent student independent if he\n                     or she determines this action would be reasonable in light of documented unusual or\n                     unique circumstances. NOTE: Parents refusal to contribute financially or unwillingness to complete the Free\n                     Application for Federal Student Aid, or the student not being claimed on the parent(s)'\n                     Federal Tax Return, or the student showing self-sufficiency are not reasons to declare\n                     a student independent for Federal Student Financial Aid. However, some unusual circumstances which qualify as reasons to declare a student\n                     independent may include, but are not limited to: parental abandonment of the student,\n                     leaving an abusive family environment which threatens the student's physical/emotional\n                     health or safety, or a student's inability to locate parents for a long-term and on-going\n                     basis.\u00a0\u00a0 Students may complete the Dependency Override process on  Owl Express .\u00a0 All requests for a Dependency Override must be processed by June 15th for the current\n                     academic year, for example, for the 2021-2022 academic year requests must be processed\n                     by June 15, 2022. \u00a0Requests received after the June 15th date will not be considered.

After you receive your award notice and have become familiar with your financial aid\n                     awards and \u201cTerms and Conditions,\u201d what should you do next?\u00a0 If you are awarded \u201cGift\n                     Aid\u201d (any grant or scholarship money \u2013 which does not need to be repaid, i.e., HOPE,\n                     Pell, etc.), these funds do not require acceptance on your part.\u00a0 If you have been\n                     awarded student loans, you will need to accept, decline or reduce the amount of loan\n                     you wish to receive or not receive.\u00a0 All new undergraduates who have accepted all or a partial amount of student loans\n                     must complete a Master Promissory Note (MPN) and an Entrance Loan Counseling.\u00a0 Both\n                     of these should be completed by\u00a0visiting \u00a0 www.studentloans.gov .\u00a0 The MPN will remain active for 10 years from the day of completion if a student\n                     continually receives students loans and there is no break of 12 months or more. Kennesaw State University is part of the University System of Georgia (USG).\u00a0 Payment\n                     procedures are determined by USG policy and deadlines are very specific.\u00a0 It is important\n                     to remember, the Financial Aid Office awards financial aid while the Bursar\u2019s Office\n                     charges, collects and refunds. Important Dates are always available on the\u00a0 Bursar ,\u00a0 Registrar , and\u00a0 Financial Aid \u00a0websites.\u00a0  These websites are updated each term and you should become familiar with these very\n                     important dates.\u00a0 This is how financial aid assists with charges in the Bursar\u2019s Office: It is important to remember the following regarding the disbursement of financial\n                     aid: Entering applicants are sent an electronic award notification. These notifications\n                     will be sent via the student\u2019s KSU email account (all communication will be sent to\n                     a student\u2019s KSU email account).\u00a0 Here are some basic steps: If you need assistance with this setup, you may contact \u00a0 UITS for KSU .\u00a0 IMPORTANT \u00a0 \u2013 If documentation is requested (most often by the US Dept. of ED) to complete your\n                     awarding process, you must validate your account. Please submit any required documentation as quickly as possible. The OSFA begins notifying current students in early spring term as applications are\n                     received.\u00a0 If additional documentation is requested, you can find it on your Owl Express\n                     account.\u00a0 Once all documentation is received, you will be awarded and notified via\n                     your KSU email account.\u00a0 All documentation must be received no later than May 1 (for fall term) in order to\n                     consider you for all aid programs. If you do not submit the requested documents, we\n                     will not be able to process your financial aid application and financial aid will\n                     not be disbursed to your KSU Student Account in the Bursar\u2019s Office to assist with\n                     educational expenses.

Carefully read the remainder of this information as it contains very important\n                     information and policies concerning your financial aid package. Your 2022-2023 financial aid notice, which is awarded based on full-time attendance,\n                     may include one or more of the following (disbursement of aid will not occur before\n                     classes begin and enrollment is verified.): Federal Pell Grant: \u00a0 This federal grant is available to undergraduate students who have NOT received a\n                     baccalaureate degree. Eligibility is determined by the Expected Family Contribution\n                     (EFC) as calculated using information provided by the student/parent on the FAFSA.\n                     Funds from this award will be divided equally between the Fall and Spring semesters\n                     and will be credited to the student\u2019s account accordingly. Student\u2019s now may have\n                     eligibility for summer Pell Grant under certain conditions. Eligibility for summer\n                     Pell Grant is determined each year in the early spring. A Pell Grant award is based on the number of hours a student is enrolled. Typically,\n                     the posted award amount is based on full-time enrollment. Should a student not enroll\n                     for 12 or more hours (full-time), the award will be prorated at disbursement based\n                     on enrollment, i.e., \u00be time, \u00bd time, < \u00bd time. Award amounts vary \u2013 yet may range\n                     from $650-$6,495 annually. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG): \u00a0 This federal grant is awarded based on the student\u2019s EFC and the availability of funds.\n                     Applicants who file by the priority date of March 1 st \u00a0 are reviewed first. Only students who are Pell Grant eligible may receive this grant\n                     (undergraduate students who have not received a baccalaureate degree). This fund is\n                     extremely limited and not all eligible students may receive funds. Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan: \u00a0 This is a low interest loan that enters repayment six months after the student ceases\n                     to be enrolled at least on a half-time basis (6 hours). The term \u201cSubsidized\u201d means\n                     that the government pays the interest on the loan while the student is enrolled in\n                     school. Students must be enrolled in 6 hours or more to be eligible during a specific\n                     term. Eligibility is determined by filing the FAFSA. This is a need-based loan. To complete the loan process, please visit \u00a0 financialaid.kennesaw.edu/types-of-aid/loans . Once on this page, select Direct Loans. This provides you a step by step process.\n                        New borrowers \u00a0 will also need to complete an \u00a0 Entrance Counseling . You will only need to complete these documents (Loan Agreement and Entrance Loan\n                     Counseling) ONCE. For \u00a0 additional information regarding Direct Loans . If a student borrower withdraws or drops below \u00bd time, \u00a0 Exit Loan Counseling \u00a0 must be completed before returning to KSU \u2013 even if the student intends on returning\n                        the following term. Freshmen may be eligible to borrow up to $3,500, sophomores $4,500, juniors and seniors\n                        $5,500. \u00a0 After the loan is awarded and accepted by the student via Owl Express, the student\n                     will be required to complete a Loan Agreement. The \u00a0 Loan Agreement for a Subsidized/Unsubsidized Loan (MPN ) \u00a0 must be completed and must be signed electronically (utilizing the FSA ID - it can\n                     be retrieved at https://fsaid.ed.gov/). This is required for the loan to disburse.\n                     In addition, the student must complete \u00a0 Entrance Loan Counseling . In addition, should the student withdraw from the University prior to the school\n                     receiving the loan disbursement, the student will be ineligible to receive the loan\n                     award, and the funds will be returned. Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan: \u00a0 This loan program provides financial assistance to all eligible students regardless\n                     of income. The FAFSA is required for determining eligibility. This loan is very similar\n                     to the Subsidized Stafford Loan in that the repayment terms and loan limits by class\n                     standing are the same. The difference is that the student, rather than the federal\n                     government, is responsible for paying the interest on the loan while he or she is\n                     enrolled. Loan proceeds from the Unsubsidized Stafford Loan will be disbursed like\n                     the Subsidized Stafford above, and the total amount of both the Subsidized and Unsubsidized\n                     Stafford Loans may not be more than the annual loan limits set for the student\u2019s class\n                     standing. Students must be enrolled in 6 hours or more to be eligible during a specific\n                     term. All eligible dependent undergraduate students are\u00a0eligible for $2,000 annually\n                     \u2013 in addition to the amount of Stafford eligibility, i.e., Freshmen = $3,500 + $2,000. Federal College Work-Study: \u00a0 The \u00a0 Federal Work-Study ( FWS ) \u00a0 Program provides jobs for undergraduate and graduate students who demonstrate financial\n                     need. FWS gives the student an opportunity of working on campus or in a community\n                     service position on a part-time basis. FWS students may work up to 20 hours per week.\n                     Pay rate is determined based on job type, job duties and experience, but must meet\n                     the federal minimum wage of $7.25. The FAFSA is required. For additional information\n                     please visit \u00a0 our \u00a0 Federal Work Study Program page . \u00a0 Funding is limited as prescribed by the U. S. Dept. of Education. Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students ( PLUS ): \u00a0 This federal loan is a long term, low interest loan available to parents of dependent\n                     students regardless of income level. KSU requires the completion of the FAFSA to receive\n                     this loan. The annual loan limit is equal to the cost of attending KSU less any financial\n                     assistance the student is receiving. This loan enters repayment 60 days after the\n                     last disbursement of each year. Parents must demonstrate credit worthiness to receive\n                     this loan. The loan proceeds are divided equally between the Fall and Spring terms.\n                     The student must be enrolled when the disbursements are received by the school. A\n                     separate loan application must be filed in order to receive these funds. \u00a0 Applying for a PLUS Loan \u00a0 must be completed with the U. S. Federal Government. \u00a0 Apply for PLUS Loan Georgia HOPE Scholarship and Grant: \u00a0 The \u00a0 HOPE \u00a0 program is a state scholarship funded by the Georgia State Lottery for Education.\n                     The HOPE scholarship will pay for as many hours as a student chooses to enroll up\n                     to a maximum of 15 credit hours per semester. For eligibility criteria and specifics\n                     regarding the HOPE Program, please view \u00a0 GAfutures . Students must complete the \u00a0 FAFSA \u00a0 or the \u00a0 Georgia Scholarship/Grant Application (GSFAPPS) . KSU Foundation Scholarships: \u00a0 There are need-based and merit scholarships available for both undergraduate and graduate\n                     students. Available scholarships are listed under the appropriate college. For information,\n                     please visit the \u00a0 Kennesaw State University Scholarship \u00a0Web Site . Expenses for Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 A listing of direct costs can be obtained at the following link (2022-2023 tuition\n                     and fees have not been established yet): http://finance.kennesaw.edu/bursar/tuitionfees.php . For information regarding payment options, please view the \u2018How to Pay\u2019 link at: \u00a0 http://finance.kennesaw.edu/bursar/payments.php Enrollment Policy: \u00a0 To be eligible to receive need-based financial aid other than the Federal Pell Grant,\n                     a student must be enrolled at least half-time (6 hours) in a program leading to the\n                     receipt of a degree. A student who is enrolled less than half-time may be eligible\n                     to receive a Pell Grant as long as the student is seeking their first baccalaureate\n                     degree. A student\u2019s financial aid award may be adjusted at any point in the term due\n                     to enrollment changes or noted errors on the part of the student, parent or the institution. Refund Policy after Official/Unofficial Withdrawals (Title IV Funds): \u00a0 To withdraw officially from the University, a student must complete an official withdrawal\n                     form in the Office of the Registrar or online. The date the Office of the Registrar\n                     signs and approves the withdrawal form is the official date KSU will use in the calculation\n                     of any tuition refund or refund to Federal student aid and/or HOPE scholarship programs.\n                     Students who do not formally and completely withdraw are not eligible for a refund. As part of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, Congress passed provisions governing\n                     what must happen to your Federal financial assistance if you completely withdraw from\n                     school in any semester. If a student withdraws from KSU, then the University or the\n                     student may be required to return some of the federal aid and/or HOPE Scholarship\n                     funds awarded to the student. Title IV Funds (Federal): \u00a0 For those students who withdraw and are receiving federal funding, the refund policy\n                     of Title IV Funds (back to federal programs) is dictated by federal regulations governing\n                     Title IV financial aid programs. These programs must be refunded according to the\n                     calculations prescribed by federal regulations based on the date of withdrawal and\n                     percentage of time enrolled. Within 45 days of the date of withdrawal being determined,\n                     the amount of funding that must be returned to the Title IV programs will be calculated,\n                     and the student\u2019s financial aid award will be adjusted accordingly. This will occur\n                     within 45 days of the official date of withdrawal, or, in the cases of unofficial\n                     withdrawals (see below); the date that the school has determined the student has withdrawn.\n                     Students who have federal loans are required to complete an exit loan counseling. Non-Attendance/Unofficial Withdrawals: \u00a0 Students who register for classes, and do not attend at least one class session, are\n                     not eligible to receive any federal, state, or institutional funds. Students who attend\n                     at least one class, cease attending all classes, and do not officially withdraw from\n                     the University, are considered to have unofficially withdrawn and are subject to proration\n                     even if the school becomes aware of the lack of attendance at the end of the term\n                     or after the term has concluded. Repayment Policy After Official/Unofficial Withdrawals: \u00a0 In the case of an official or unofficial withdrawal from the University, a student\n                     who receives a cash disbursement of Title IV financial aid funds may have to repay\n                     the University a percentage of those Title IV funds depending on the length of enrollment\n                     and the amount of financial aid awarded to the student. If, according to the federal\n                     calculations, a student has been \u201coverpaid,\u201d the student will be required to repay\u00a0the\n                     excess amount to the University for reimbursement to the federal programs. If the\n                     student fails to repay the calculated amount, the student will be reported to the\n                     U. S. Department of Education and will be ineligible for any other Title IV assistance\n                     at any school. Policy Federal regulations, HEA Sec. 484(c), \u00a7668.16, 668.34, require all schools participating\n                     in Title IV federal financial aid programs to have a Satisfactory Academic Progress\n                     (SAP) policy that conforms to the requirements detailed below. These requirements\n                     apply to all students as one determinant of eligibility for financial aid. 1. Quantitative Requirement The quantitative requirement has two parts: Undergraduate Students Maximum time frame (maximum attempted credit hours)  \u2013 You must earn your degree before reaching 180 attempted credit hours, which includes\n                     transferrable credits attempted at any school prior to and while enrolled at Kennesaw\n                     State University (KSU). Students who are seeking a second undergraduate degree different\n                     from their first degree will be granted 60 additional hours to complete the second\n                     degree requirements.\u00a0 Once you reach the maximum attempted credit hours, you are no longer eligible for\n                     financial aid as an undergraduate student.\u00a0 Completion Ratio \u2013  You must complete and pass at least 67% of all credit hours you attempt. Courses earned\n                     include grades of A, B, C, D, or S. Courses attempted include any course in which\n                     grades of A, B, C, D, F, W, WF, I, S, U or IP are given. \u00a0Graduate Students Maximum time frame  \u2013 The maximum time frame varies by degree level.\u00a0 Once you reach the maximum attempted credit hours, you are no longer eligible for\n                     financial aid as a graduate student.\u00a0 Completion Ratio \u2013  You must earn at least 67% of all attempted credit hours. Courses earned include\n                     grades of A, B, C, D, or S. Courses attempted include any course in which grades of\n                     A, B, C, D, F, W, WF, I, S, U or IP are given. 2. Qualitative Requirement The qualitative requirements sets a minimum cumulative Grade Point Average for all\n                     students. \u00a0The cumulative GPA includes grades of A, B, C, D, F, and WF. \u00a0The cumulative\n                     GPA will be checked each term for SAP. Undergraduate Students \u2013  The cumulative GPA requirement is 2.00 for each term. Graduate Students \u2013  The cumulative GPA requirement is 3.00 for each term. The cumulative GPA is evaluated at the institutional level and the overall level that\n                     includes transfer work. Students not meeting the minimum GPA requirements will be\n                     subject to warning and failure status, as applicable. Policy Details When is SAP determined? What happens when you do not meet the requirements? Maximum Time Frame (maximum attempted credit hours) \u00a0 \u2013 When you have attempted the maximum credit hours, you are no longer eligible to\n                     receive financial aid. Is there extended eligibility for a 2nd bachelor\u2019s degree? \u00a0 \u2013 \u00a0Yes. \u00a0Students pursuing a 2nd bachelor's degree are granted 240 hours of eligibility. Is there extended eligibility for a 2nd master\u2019s/graduate degree? \u00a0 - Yes. \u00a0Eligibility is based on the degree level being pursued. Low Completion Ratio \u00a0 \u2013\u00a0 How do you regain eligibility?\u00a0 Appeal Requirements: Appeal Denials or Non-appeals \u00a0 \u2013 If you are denied an appeal or you decide not to appeal, you must complete the necessary\n                     hours and earn the appropriate grades. Once you have reached the prescribed standards\n                     you become eligible to receive financial aid. You change from undergraduate to graduate \u00a0 \u2013 If you reach Failure Status as an undergraduate, and then are admitted to a graduate\n                     degree program, you will be eligible to receive financial aid as a graduate student.\n                     You must be in a degree-seeking status and fully accepted into the graduate program. Academic Circumstances that Affect Your Status: The Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid reserves the right to review denied appeals,\n                     cumulative GPA's and completion rates on a case by case basis. Federal regulations define how financial aid can be used for classes taken more than\n                     once. You \u00a0 CAN \u00a0 receive financial aid: All courses previously taken, even if financial aid was not used, are compared against\n                     the current semester to determine if it is a repeated class and whether it can be\n                     paid for using financial aid. Your financial aid may be recalculated if you\u00a0take a\n                     class that is not eligible for financial aid. This policy does not provide exceptions\n                     if the repeat courses are taken to meet plan of study grade requirements, i.e. a grade\n                     of C or higher must be earned to count towards your major. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The repeat coursework rules only apply to undergraduate students. Repeating a course\n                     can also impact your \u00a0 Satisfactory Academic Progress \u00a0 status (SAP). All grades count for SAP and all hours attempted and earned count as\n                     well. \u00a0 PLEASE NOTE : If you have questions regarding your courses and repeat coursework, please contact\n                     your \u00a0 financial aid counselor . The rules for repeat coursework are quite complex and your individual situation\n                     will need to be reviewed. Per federal regulation KSU is required to prorate a dependent or independent undergraduate\n                     student's annual Stafford loan limits, when they are enrolled in one semester and\n                     will graduate in the same academic year. This mostly will affect students that will\n                     graduate from their program of study at the end of the fall term. Loan Proration Formula: Students at KSU are awarded based on estimated full-time enrollment (12 credit hours).\n                     Once drop/add ends, the Office of Student Financial Aid adjusts the tuition and fee\n                     components in the Cost of Attendance to actual charges. The resulting change in Cost\n                     of Attendance can create an over or under award situation and aid is adjusted accordingly. The Department of Education requires schools to identify the courses that may be included\n                     in the calculation of enrollment (Full-time, 3/4-time, 1/2-time, and less than half-time)\n                     for award and disbursement of Federal Funds. The Office of Student Financial Aid will review these items prior to payment of federal\n                     aid. Students at KSU are awarded based on their current NSLDS record, which reflects their\n                     federal loan borrowing history at the time of receipt. However, the records may not\n                     always be accurate due to timing. Therefore, KSU, will conduct a pre-screening process\n                     to capture students who may potentially be approaching or exceeding their aggregate\n                     loan borrowing limit. The intent is to capture any overawards prior to the disbursement\n                     of aid to prevent any unnecessary return of funds. In addition, a post-screening process\n                     is conducted to capture any student who may have inadvertently exceeded their aggregate\n                     borrowing limit. These students are identified as a result of updated NSLDS records\n                     pushed to the institution by the Department of Education. The resulting change in\n                     a student\u2019s loan borrowing history can create an overaward and aid will be adjusted\n                     accordingly.

If a student withdraws from Kennesaw\n                     State University or withdraws from all degree applicable courses, then the University\n                     or the student may be required to return some of the federal aid and/or HOPE scholarship\n                     funds awarded to the student. The student may also be eligible for a refund of a portion\n                     of the tuition and fees paid to KSU for the semester. KSU Withdrawal Process Withdrawing from classes can affect your GPA and your Satisfactory Academic Progress\n                     (SAP,) which can adversely affect both state and federal financial aid. Please carefully\n                     read our Satisfactory Academic Progress policy so you don't have any surprises when\n                     it comes to your financial aid. Financial Aid strongly suggests you go to the \u00a0 Registrar's website \u00a0 to read additional information that may affect you and your grades. KSU Institutional Refund Policy The refund amount for students withdrawing from KSU is based on a pro rata percentage\n                     determined by dividing the number of calendar days in the semester the student completed\n                     by the total calendar days in the semester. The total calendar days in a semester\n                     includes weekends, but excludes breaks of five days or more. The unearned portion\n                     shall be refunded up to the point in time that the amount equals 60%. Students that\n                     withdraw from KSU after 60% of the semester has been completed are not entitled to\n                     a refund of any portion of institutional charges. KSU Return of Title IV Federal Aid and HOPE Scholarship Policy In general, Federal and State regulations assume that you \"earn\" your federal financial\n                     aid awards and HOPE directly in proportion to the number of days of the term that\n                     you attend until you withdraw. If you completely withdraw from school or from all\n                     your degree applicable courses during a term, the school must calculate according\n                     to a specific formula the portion of the total scheduled financial assistance you\n                     have earned and are therefore entitled to receive up to the time you withdraw. If\n                     you or KSU receives more assistance than you earn, the unearned excess funds must\n                     be returned to the Department of Education or State HOPE office. Also, if you or KSU\n                     receives less assistance than the amount you have earned, you may be able to receive\n                     those additional funds. The portion of your federal student aid or HOPE scholarship you are entitled to receive\n                     is calculated on a percentage basis by comparing the total number of days in the semester\n                     to the number of days you completed before you withdrew. For example, if you complete\n                     30% of the semester, you earn 30% of the assistance you were originally scheduled\n                     to receive. This means that 70% of your scheduled awards remain unearned and must\n                     be returned to the Department of Education or State HOPE office. Once you have completed more than 60% of the semester, you have earned all (100%)\n                     of your assistance. If you withdraw from KSU before completing 60% of the semester,\n                     you may have to repay any unearned financial aid funds that were already disbursed\n                     to you. If you received excess funds based on this calculation, KSU must return a portion\n                     of the excess equal to the lesser of: If KSU is not required to return all the excess funds, you must return the remaining\n                     amount. The order that KSU and you must return these funds is as follows: If you are required to repay \u00a0 loan \u00a0 funds, this is done in accordance with the terms of your loan promissory note. If\n                     you must repay any \u00a0 grant \u00a0 funds, the law states that you are not required to repay 50% of the grant assistance\n                     that you were calculated to repay. Any grant amount that a student must repay is considered\n                     a grant overpayment and therefore must be repaid to KSU within 45 days. Effective Date Kennesaw State University's current institutional refund policies regarding Title\n                     IV and HOPE Scholarship funds have been in effect since August 19, 2000.

By bundling both degrees into Pathways, highly\n                     motivated and committed students will graduate sooner than their peers and with a\n                     head start on their careers. KSU has a variety of Pathways to choose from with more\n                     being added. A Double Owl Pathway allows students to accelerate their progress toward a master's\n                                    degree by taking graduate-level coursework during the final year of their undergraduate\n                                    studies. Students save time and money by earning a master's degree in one year instead\n                                    of two and enter the workforce with a more advanced complement of knowledge and skills. Save Time -  Through this accelerated model, you can take up to 9 credit hours of graduate-level\n                                       courses as an undergraduate student. Those 9 credit hours will simultaneously satisfy\n                                       both your undergraduate and graduate program requirements. Certain Pathways will allow\n                                       you to finish both degrees in as little as 5 years. Save Money  - Double Owl Pathways provide students the best value for their education by giving\n                                       them the chance to satisfy graduate-level courses at the undergraduate tuition rate. Earn Opportunities  - A Double Owl Pathway will not only position you ahead of your peers academically but also will allow you to combine undergraduate and graduate degrees in specific fields to enhance job opportunities.\u00a0 Fast-Track Your Career\u00a0 - Enter the workforce sooner than your peers giving you the upper hand on professional\n                                       advancement and a higher earning potential. All current undergraduate students are eligible to apply for a Double Owl Pathway.\n                                 Each program has a program advisor who can provide you with more information. Students apply to the graduate program separate from the Double Owl Pathway application,\n                                 Each Double Owl Pathway has its own requirements for graduate admission. Your Double\n                                 Owl Pathway advisor will guide you through this process. You can take up to  9 hours  of graduate-level courses as an undergraduate student that count toward both your\n                                 undergraduate and graduate degree program requirements. Requirements vary among Double\n                                 Owl Pathways. Please contact the Double Owl Pathway advisor of your desired program\n                                 for more information.

The below provides a short description of Financial Aid policies.\n                     If you would like more information, you can use the tabs to read the full policy.\n                     If you have any questions our Financial Aid counselors are ready to offer support\n                     and guidance. You can find your counselor on our  Contact Us  page. Information in this policy is more detailed and of all the material found on the Scholarships\n                     and Financial Aid website. Higher education financial aid professionals are bound by a code of conduct, the details\n                     of which are provided in this Code of Conduct. The earliest that a KSU may disburse Federal Student Aid funds to the student's account\n                     is 10 days before the first day of classes for that payment period. In order to receive any financial aid funds, you must be in attendance at Kennesaw\n                     State University. However, if you are studying away from the KSU campus, transcripts\n                     are required to document your attendance. Final grades (transcript) must be received\n                     to determine your continued financial aid eligibility. Once KSU allows you to take\n                     coursework at another institution, the Financial Aid Office will immediately place\n                     a \u201cHOLD\u201d on your financial aid account. This hold will remain until the transcript\n                     has been received by KSU and a determination is made regarding eligibility criteria\n                     being met for the education experience away from KSU. If you reduce your course load during the term, you may not be eligible for the entire\n                     award offered to you.\u00a0 In the event you need to withdraw from all courses, and receive\n                     Federal Financial Aid or HOPE Scholarship, we encourage you to consult with our experienced\n                     Financial Aid counselors to determine what impact dropping or withdrawing classes\n                     may have. If you withdraw who withdraw from school before completing 60% of the enrollment period\n                     may be required to repay all or a portion of the financial aid funds back to the school\n                     or to the U.S. Department of Education. In some situations, you can use financial aid to pay for classes you repeat. It is\n                     important to check with your Financial Aid Office regarding Satisfactory Academic\n                     Progress (SAP) requirements and the impact of repeat coursework and completion rates\n                     on financial aid eligibility. It is also important to know that in addition to the Federal guidelines on repeating\n                     coursework, KSU has an internal policy which governs your ability to retake courses\n                     as well as use financial aid to cover them. The NCAA has issued specific guidelines describing the circumstances under which an\n                     athletic grant-in-aid can be canceled during the term of the award. Policies and procedures\n                     have been established by KSU relating to the cancellation, nonrenewal or reduction\n                     in size of an athletic grant-in-aid and the steps that a student-athlete may take\n                     to appeal changes in grant-in-aid status. These policies are established by KSU. Changes\n                     to the policy may be made at any time at the discretion of KSU. Federal regulations require that a student has met -\u00a0and continues to meet - some\n                     basic academic progress\u00a0standards before he/she can receive federal financial aid.  You\u00a0must meet the requirements of the KSU SAP policy of the school\u00a0he/she to be eligible\u00a0for\n                     federal financial aid.    If you do not meet SAP requirements,\u00a0this policy explains your options\u00a0and how to\n                     get back to good standing, as well as appeal\u00a0and approval processes.

FERPA governs\n                  the disclosure of student records maintained by an educational institution as well\n                  as access to those records. Students enrolled in any course offered by KSU, at any\n                  location or through any method of delivery (i.e., campus/on-site, hybrid, partially\n                  online and fully online) are covered by FERPA. KSU defines an admitted student as\n                  one who is in attendance upon enrollment/registration for classes. Institutions that\n                  receive funds administered by the U.S. Department of Education are bound by FERPA\n                  requirements and failure to comply may result in the loss of federal funding. WHAT IS AN EDUCATIONAL RECORD?  In general, the term means records that are directly related to a student and are\n                  maintained by an educational institution. This include most anything about a student\n                  that is written down, regardless of whether it is in a formal document or in an email\n                  or letter, recording or photograph. FERPA grants four specific rights to the student: FERPA applies to all educational agencies or institutions, including Kennesaw State\n                  University (KSU), which receive funds under any program administered by the U.S. Department\n                  of Education. FERPA governs \u00a0 what \u00a0 may be released, but \u00a0 does not require \u00a0 that any information be released. Directory information can be shared without written consent, but all other Education\n                           Records can only be released with the student\u2019s consent or if certain exemptions set\n                           forth in the FERPA regulations are met. \u00a0Further, a student can request in writing,\n                           each semester that his or her Directory Information not be released. Below is the information that KSU has defined as being Directory Information. If it\n                           is not on this list, it is not Directory Information and cannot be released without\n                           the the student\u2019s consent (unless another exception to FERPA applies): **While Student email addresses is directory information, the contents of a student\u2019s\n                           email is not directory information. \u00a0 If you are ever in doubt, do not release any information until you contact the Office\n                           of the Registrar: 470-578-6415. The Office of the Registrar is the only university office authorized to issue official\n                           transcripts and certify students\u2019 enrollment status. All requests for such documentation\n                           must be directed to this office.

At KSU, students are notified of their FERPA rights in the Student Handbook, university\n                           catalog, and the Registrar's webpage. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords eligible students certain\n                           rights with respect to their education records.\u00a0 (An \u201celigible student\u201d under FERPA\n                           is a student who is 18 years of age or older or who attends a postsecondary institution.)\u00a0\n                           These rights include: See the list below of the disclosures that postsecondary institutions may make without\n                           consent. FERPA permits the disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from students\u2019\n                           education records, without consent of the student, if the disclosure meets certain\n                           conditions found in \u00a799.31 of the FERPA regulations.\u00a0 Except for disclosures to school\n                           officials, disclosures related to some judicial orders or lawfully issued subpoenas,\n                           disclosures of directory information, and disclosures to the student, \u00a799.32 of FERPA\n                           regulations requires the institution to record the disclosure.\u00a0 Eligible students\n                           have a right to inspect and review the record of disclosures.\u00a0 A postsecondary institution\n                           may disclose PII from the education records without obtaining prior written consent\n                           of the student \u2013 Kennesaw State University may disclose personally identifiable information from an\n                           education record to appropriate parties, including parents of an eligible student,\n                           in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect\n                           the health or safety of the student or other individuals. In the case of an emergency, direct all student information requests to Public Safety:\n                           470-578-6666. Violations of this policy are reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

Attending college is an\n                  expensive\u00a0and invaluable investment in your future. Protect your investment by spending,\n                  borrowing, and saving WISELY! Managing  your  money  can be challenging, especially as a college student. The Office of Scholarships and\n                  Financial Aid staff is equipped and available to help you be smarter with your money\n                  and build a better future. How you manage your money during your college years will have a major impact on your\n                  life after college. To graduate with as little debt as possible, you need to plan\n                  now, create a personal budget, and stick to it. No matter what system of budgeting\n                  you choose, you must stick to it and resist splurges and impulse-buying. If you do\n                  slip up, get right back to your plan. Adopt the \u201cpay yourself first\u201d attitude towards\n                  saving in order to build an emergency fund and to plan future purchases. Remember,\n                  budgeting isn\u2019t about restricting yourself, but about financially empowering yourself!\n                  A budget creates confidence. When it comes to paying for essentials like food and\n                  rent, you know you\u2019ve got it covered! If you\u2019ve taken out student loans, remember that the loan money is for your education.\u00a0Never\n                  borrow more than you need!\u00a0A general rule of borrowing is that your total loan debt\n                  when you leave school should be less than what you might earn as your starting annual\n                  salary after you graduate.\u00a0Ideally, your monthly loan payment should be no more than\n                  10% of your monthly paycheck. When you borrow student loans, you\u2019ve made a  legal commitment\u00a0 to  pay back the money  with interest.\u00a0Subsidized loans do not accrue interest while you are enrolled in\n                  at least 6 credit hours.  Unsubsidized loans  accrue interest as soon as the loan is disbursed to you. A wise student borrower will plan to pay the interest on any unsubsidized loans while\n                  still in college. A few dollars a month in interest payments will keep the unsubsidized\n                  loans from growing. Students who borrow through\u00a0private lenders should contact their lenders directly\n                  for up-to-date information. Remember that, unlike federal student loans, the interest\n                  rates on private loans may be variable. It is a good rule of thumb to always know what you owe and track your student loan\n                  debt. Learn how to use the  National Student Loan Data System  to see everything about your federal loan balances. There are limits to how much\n                  you\u2019re allowed to borrow each year and over your cumulative student career. You are\n                  responsible for knowing these  aggregate loan limits . Students who know how much they owe can plan their postgraduate lifestyle to allow\n                  for the quickest possible loan repayment. You can estimate your monthly loan payment\n                  by using the U.S. Department of Education's  interactive calculator  on the  Federal Student Aid  web site and choosing the different  repayment plan options . There are also some  Federal Student Loan forgiveness programs .\u00a0 If you ever experience any difficulty in making a loan payment, contact your  loan servicer  immediately to prevent  loan default . The loan servicer will work with you and explore all options to avoid default. Keep\n                  in mind that student loan indebtedness cannot be forgiven by bankruptcy.\u00a0 The Federal\n                  Government can require your employer to garnish your wages and the IRS can keep your\n                  tax refunds to pay down your debt.\u00a0 Your eligibility for financial aid, whether it\u2019s in the form of loans (whether Federal\n                  or private), grants (like Pell and Hope), scholarships, or Federal Work Study, all\n                  depend on your success as a student.\u00a0 You must maintain  Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) . If you fall below the SAP standards, you won\u2019t be eligible for any financial aid\n                  at KSU and most other colleges and universities.\u00a0 To protect your financial aid eligibility,\n                  avoid withdrawing from courses after Add/Drop and always seek  academic or counseling assistance  if you\u2019re experiencing academic or personal difficulties that impact your academic\n                  success. In order to continue receiving financial aid and to maintain eligibility, you must\n                  maintain  Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)  and complete a\u00a0FAFSA each year at  www.FAFSA.ed.gov . Building good credit\u00a0is essential for your life after graduation.\u00a0 Not only is a good\n                  credit rating important for buying a car or a home, your future employer may view\n                  your credit score as an indicator of your level of responsibility during the hiring\n                  process. Your credit rating is a combination of your fixed debt, like your student\n                  loans, and revolving debt like credit cards.\u00a0 Maintaining checking and savings accounts\n                  and paying off debts on time are the important steps to good credit. 6 Tips to Creating Good Credit You\u2019re entitled to one  free credit report  each year which has the information from the three main credit reporting bureaus nationwide\n                  ( Equifax ,  Experian , and  TransUnion ).\u00a0It\u2019s important to\u00a0understand your credit score and check your report for errors\n                  and possible identity theft. College students are especially vulnerable and should take steps to protect themselves\n                  from scams,\u00a0identity theft and fraud. There are two types of identity theft. The first is \"account takeover\" which happens when someone gets your existing account\n                  information and uses that account to make purchases. The second is \"true name\" fraud which happens when someone gains access to your personal\n                  information, such as your social security number, and uses it to fraudulently open\n                  new accounts. Never carry your social security card, and don\u2019t share login information.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) , an American federal law, gives you specific rights when you are, or believe that\n                  you are, the victim of identity theft. The Federal Trade Commission has developed\n                  a workbook designed to help you protect your credit:  Taking Charge: WHAT TO DO IF YOUR IDENTITY IS STOLEN Students can search for scholarships offered through Kennesaw State University and\n                  external scholarship websites by using  Scholarship Universe , which lists scholarships by student type, KSU category, external category, major\n                  or keyword.

Since 2003, KSU\u2019s Friends of the Library have supported student learners by providing\n                              school supplies at each campus location, supporting the growth of the library book\n                              collection through their Adopt-A-Book program, and beginning fall 2021 an Adopt-a-Textbook\n                              program for high use and high-cost materials for students to use free of charge.

The suggestion was to create a non-profit, Friends of the Library, organization\n                              to enhance and support the KSU Library\u2019s resources and services to students. That\n                              organization was established with support and membership by KSU President Betty Siegel\n                              and was called the Friends of the Horace W. Sturgis Library at Kennesaw State University. Since inception, this non-profit organization has been a non-stop force supporting\n                              the KSU Library System\u2019s mission of furthering academic student success and campus\n                              research initiatives. The Friends work to raise both awareness and funding for enhanced\n                              Library System resources, services, spaces, and library professionals. Several of\n                              the services that the KSU Friends of the Library began to provide beginning in 2003\n                              were popular reading collections, office supplies for students utilizing the photocopy\n                              machines (pencils, staplers, tape), author book talks / presentations, campus used\n                              book sales, and hosting other fundraising events. In 2015, Kennesaw State University was consolidated with Southern Polytechnical State\n                              University, and this organization was renamed the Kennesaw State University Friends\n                              of the Library supporting both the Horace W. Sturgis Library on the Kennesaw Campus\n                              and the L. V. Johnson Library on the Marietta Campus. Activities of the consolidated\n                              Friends group started in the spring of 2016 with book sales hosted annually at both\n                              libraries. In 2019 the KSU Library System reorganized. At this same time, a new unit called Engagement\n                              and Assessment Services Team (EAST) was recreated. Part of the mission and vision\n                              of EAST is to reprioritize and expand FOL activities. In 2021 the Kennesaw State University Friends of the Library began updating membership\n                              information / benefits and actively began recruiting memberships. Part of the membership\n                              drive included revitalizing the Friends by sponsoring a new series of book talks and\n                              fundraising events. One of the new initiatives was the development of an Adopt-a-Book and an Adopt-a-Textbook\n                              initiative to help building stronger library collections and off set the high cost\n                              of academic textbooks in an effort to make college more affordable. Through the power\n                              of reading and loving books, donors can honor the special people in their lives through\n                              their sponsorship materials that support the KSU curriculum. All efforts of the Kennesaw State University Friends of the Library are done to help\n                              further support student academic success through enhancing library services and resources.\n                              Your membership makes a difference.

Mishkin finds sanctuary in music, which has been his passion for more than half his\n                     life and will now become his career. \u201cMusic has always been there for me,\u201d he said. \u201cMusic just provides a sense of comfort and allows me to be who I am, live in my skin and be confident in my abilities.\u201d \n                      Sammy Mishkin  \n                      \n                   Mishkin, who graduated magna cum laude in May from the  College of the Arts  with his  Bachelor of Music  in performance, wants to be a professional pianist and is taking the first steps toward that goal this summer. He auditioned successfully for the Collaborative Piano Program at the American Institute for Musical Studies (AIMS) in Graz, Austria, where singers and pianists learn techniques to begin a career in Europe\u2019s highly competitive music industry.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019ve heard about this program a lot, and my colleagues, professors and family have been pushing me to pursue these opportunities. So, I decided that now was the right time for me to finally act on my most desired ambitions.\u201d said Mishkin, who grew up in Cumming, Ga. \u201cIt\u2019s truly an honor to have earned a spot.\u201d Mishkin was one of very few undergraduates to earn a spot from among hundreds of applicants. He said the vast majority of the vocalists and pianists at AIMS have or are actively pursuing a master\u2019s or doctoral degree and are seeking career enrichment. Mishkin, who is also a graduate of  KSU Journey Honors College , credits music as a calming outlet for his active mind. His specialty of collaborative piano \u2013 playing piano to work with vocalists or instrumentalists \u2013 allows Mishkin to process multiple tasks at once.\n                      \n                   \u201cCollaborative piano requires a player to jump from one idea to another idea and to be constantly on the move mentally,\u201d Mishkin said. \u201cSome people just have a knack for being able to fixate on 20 different things at once, and that's one of the biggest advantages I have.\u201d Senior lecturer of music Judith Cole has worked extensively with Mishkin and said he\u2019s the first Kennesaw State piano major to make it into AIMS. KSU vocalists have earned spots there, and University music professors have taught there, but Mishkin\u2019s successful audition is a big moment for the piano program, she said. \u201cHe\u2019s so bright, so committed and so willing to work hard to go where he wants to go,\u201d she said. \u201cTo have him make it into AIMS is just a huge step toward putting our program at a higher level of recognition.\u201d Mishkin\u2019s association with Kennesaw State goes back more than 10 years, when he started taking piano lessons from assistant professor of piano Robert Henry and performing recitals in the  Dr. Bobbie Bailey & Family Performance Center . He made an easy choice when it came time to choose a college, and he continued studying\n                     with Henry and Cole. A percussionist during his school years growing up, he also took\n                     classes in voice and conducting while at KSU but maintained his major in piano. \u201cI knew I wanted to play music for a living from the time I came to campus, and initially my professors told me to slow down a little,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they realized I knew what I wanted to do, and ultimately, they helped me get there. I\u2019m happy with the unique educational experiences and opportunities I got at Kennesaw State.\u201d \n                      The experience at AIMS is focused on honing overall piano skills, but particularly accompaniment with individual vocalists and instrumentalists \u2013 \u201ccoaching the art song,\u201d according to the AIMS website. Mishkin will participate in master sessions with vocalists and vocal coaches, which he said will make him a more well-rounded and complete musician. After returning from Austria, Mishkin will spend a year during which he will continue to accompany instrumentalists, singers and choirs around metro Atlanta. He currently offers piano and voice lessons and coaching, and he said he will continue to do that. He plans to pursue a master\u2019s degree starting in the 2023-24 school year, preferably at one of the conservatories in Europe and to continue playing piano for a living, as he has wanted to do for so long. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a long-term career goal of mine to go international as a piano player, and this is the first step,\u201d he said. \u201cMy experience at Kennesaw State helped set me on that path.\u201d \u2014\u00a0 By Dave Shelles Photo by David Caselli 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Making Their Mark: Newest KSU alumni are ready for the world Spring 2022 Commencement Kennesaw State alumna lights up the stage on national tour of hit musical A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

An internship is typically a single semester work experience (paid or unpaid)\n                     that offers students an opportunity to engage in further career exploration, supplementing\n                     academic and classroom learning. Typically, students must be in a position at least\n                     80% related to their area of study and must work at least 10 hours per week. A co-op\n                     is similar in that it provides hands-on experience in the student\u2019s major field, but\n                     co-ops are paid positions lasting at least 2 semesters.\u00a0 Internships and co-ops are managed through our  Handshake  platform.

Alternating Co-op Undergraduates commit to work with the same employer in a major-related paid position\n                        for three semesters over a five semester period, alternating between full-time work\n                        and full-time academic coursework on an every-other-semester basis. Undergraduates\n                        must have 30 hours of coursework completed and a 2.5 GPA to begin the program and\n                        must maintain a 2.5 GPA throughout.

Students may receive academic credit for their\n                        participation (with an eligible major) and the position may be paid or unpaid, depending\n                        on the major.

College/Department approved internships and co-ops may have eligibility requirements\n                        above and beyond those of the Department of Career Planning & Development. Approval to award academic credit for an internship experience is based solely on\n                        the criteria established by individual academic units as well as the student\u2019s eligibility\n                        to receive academic credit. The process begins with the student reviewing the guidelines\n                        for eligibility with the Career and Internship Advisor assigned to their major. You can review all of the individual requirements by major by  following this link  and selecting a college from the list at the bottom of the page.

When you use keyword search, remember, it's searching for\n                              each individual word, NOT the phrase you typed in. Results are returned in order of\n                              most recently posted to oldest, NOT by relevancy. So, it may be important to go to\n                              the last page of your results, because your dream job might have been posted several\n                              weeks ago! Try browsing instead. \u00a0 When you're on the Jobs page, where it's showing all postings, head into Advanced\n                              Search immediately. There, you can narrow down by location and job type, but you can\n                              also search in specific industries, or by Job Function. This is where you'll find\n                              great jobs and internships that might never be listed in your Recommended Jobs tab.\n                              You're a Geography major, and you searched 'geography' with no luck? Try Job Function\n                              categories like Agriculture/Natural Resources/Environment, Government/Policy, Research,\n                              an International Organizations, and suddenly\u00a0you should see a lot more options. Check back often. \u00a0 Obviously like your hunt for the perfect job or internship, it's a fast-changing landscape\n                              and organizations are looking for great talent all the time, not just during the Career\n                              Fair seasons or around graduation. The 'real world' isn't bound by the semester schedule.\n                              Dozens of new\u00a0jobs are posted every week. So check back every few days if you're looking\n                              for something soon, or at least once a month if you're looking casually. Interview without leaving campus.\u00a0 There are employers every semester who utilize our On-Campus Interviewing (OCI) service,\n                              which means you apply to open positions posted in Handshake, then they contact you\n                              if they're interested, to schedule an interview that takes place right inside our\n                              offices. To find current OCI postings, head to the Jobs main board, and you'll see\n                              the tab for On-Campus Interviewing, which will bring up the full list of current opportunities. Use the other resources in the top menu. \u00a0 \u00a0The Employer Directory, information about the Career Fairs, and the Career Finder\n                              and Career Explorer tools are all waiting to assist you. Go ahead, click around a\n                              bit. It's a resource and tool, so it won't find a job for you. \u00a0 That's still up to you! Found a great employer but they're not hiring interns at the\n                              moment? Save the information you find, and check back later. Better yet, head to their\n                              website to see if there's more information about their opportunities, or a way to\n                              contact them directly. \u00a0 \u00a0 Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

The specific requirements for vendors providing high\n                              risk services supersede the Standard Insurance Limits. Coverage types and limits are\n                              recommended minimums and should be increased as appropriate based on contract value\n                              and potential risks to the state. Procuring entities should always consult with appropriate\n                              risk management experts.

In contrast to broad-spectrum agents, the development of species-specific, \u201cnarrow-spectrum\u201d antibacterials would be of interest to the medical community serving as novel therapeutics and also to microbiologists as chemical probes to deconvolute complex bacterial communities. Over the past ten years our group has looked to Nature for inspiring chemical scaffolds and has leveraged diverted total synthesis (DTS) to study bacteria. The talk will highlight recent efforts from our lab using DTS in antibiotic discovery and development, covering antibiotic synthesis, biological evaluation, and target identification. \u00a0 The Chemistry and Biochemistry Departmental Seminar Series covers a broad range of fields in the Chemical and Biochemical Sciences. In past seminars, scientists from Academia, Government, and Industry have presented their most recent discoveries and contributions in their respective areas. This Seminar Series offers students and faculty the opportunity to interact directly with other leaders in their specializations and to gain a good overview of the entire range of fields in Chemistry and Biochemistry. \u00a0 This seminar will take place in person.\u00a0 This is in conjunction with the Molecular Biosciences Interest Group (MBIG) seminar series.

An Art4Healing\u00ae workshop allows participants to get in touch with inner feelings that many times words cannot express. Our certified facilitator will lead participants through a series of prompts as they respond by painting abstractly with acrylic colors on canvas. The method helps participants express their feelings in a safe way by associating a color with a feeling. Each participant takes home 3 completed paintings at the end of the workshop. And, NO, you do not need any art experience to participate!\u00a0This workshop is offered in partnership with\u00a0 KSU Counseling and Psychological Services. \u00a0 Make sure you arrive a few minutes early and wear comfortable clothing that you don't mind getting a little dirty; we will supply aprons and all supplies. \u00a0 UPCOMING SCHEDULE:\u00a0 \u00a0 Please\u00a0 RESERVE  your spot here\u00a0 Event Type Target Audience Tags Website Department Hashtag Your browser does not support iframes. 1000 Chastain Road  Kennesaw, GA 30144  Phone: 470-578-6000 1100 South Marietta Pkwy  Marietta, GA 30060  Phone: 470-578-6000 Privacy Statement  /  Accreditation  /  Advisories  /  Reporting Hotline  /  Open Records  /  Human Trafficking Notice  /  Feedback  /  Text Only \u00a9 Kennesaw State University.

The lab\n                              houses professional grade plotting and scanning equipment for large format printing\n                              and scanning, as well as a small photography studio with professional lighting and\n                              backdrops suitable for documenting physical models and other furniture and design\n                              projects.

Q: I\u2019m a current student at KSU but am not within the CoACM. Am I allowed to utilize\n                                 the Media Lab? A: Non-CoACM students are not normally permitted to utilize the plotters, as consumables\n                              such as ink and paper are funded through CoACM specific lab fees. Special requests\n                              to assist other departments for special events for the University are handled on a\n                              case by case basis. Priority is given to Architecture and Construction Management\n                              students. Q: Can I print/plot personal projects? A: No, since plotting consumables are paid for by CoACM specific lab fees, there is\n                              no way to handle personal projects on a pay per print basis. All printing/plotting\n                              should be to support Architecture and Construction Management courses specifically.\n                              \u00a0Exceptions would be for Design Competitions or Scholarship submissions. Q: Can I scan graphite pencil, color pencil, charcoal drawings through the roll-feed\n                                 scanner? \u00a0What if I use spray fixative? A: The roll-feed scanners are designed for scanning ink and blueline prints. \u00a0Any\n                              media which can rub off can damage the feed rollers and scanning platen, resulting\n                              in damage to media subsequently sent through the roll-feed scanner. \u00a0Spray fixative\n                              does not solve the problem, it only makes it worse, as it is a glue material which\n                              remains sticky and gums up the feed rollers. \u00a0Any drawings which are not ink or blueline\n                              drawings must be placed in an acetate sleeve, provided by the student, before going\n                              through the roll-feed scanner. Q: Are you open on the weekends? A: No, the lab is open Monday \u2013 Friday from 9am \u2013 5pm. \u00a0 Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

The shop was designed and is equipped to build small to medium sized models, using\n                              primarily wood. \u00a0The shop contains a variety of equipment that allows users to perform\n                              just about any operation that they would like on wood or in some cases other similar\n                              materials. The Woodshop is staffed by trained professionals during all hours of operation. The\n                              equipment in the Woodshop includes the following (alphabetical): The Woodshop is equipped with dust collection systems that capture dust from most\n                              of the stationary machinery. \u00a0Additional dust collection is addressed with a network\n                              of ambient air filtration units. Q: Why do I have to take the Shop Safety Training in D2L? A: The operation of woodworking equipment can be very dangerous, even fatal. \u00a0We don\u2019t\n                              want anyone to hurt themselves by using the equipment in an unsafe or inappropriate\n                              manner. \u00a0The safety training was developed and is designed to familiarize you with\n                              the rules of the shop and how to operate some of the more commonly used pieces of\n                              equipment. Q: I\u2019m not a student in the College of Architecture and Construction Management. How\n                                 do I get enrolled in the D2L Shop Safety Course? A: Come to the shop or contact shop staff via email about your desire to use the shop.\n                              Shop staff will need your first and last name and NetID to enroll you in D2L. Once\n                              enrolled, you will get an email notification to your student email. Q: How many of the safety videos are required? A: For Non-Architecture students, the first 8 videos with corresponding quizzes are\n                              required to be passed with 100% accuracy before you can use the Woodshop. Architecture\n                              students are required to watch and complete the quizzes for the first 10 videos. All\n                              videos after that are extra information for students to utilize as needed but are\n                              not required to use the shop. Q: Can I buy materials at the Wood Shop for my project? A: No. \u00a0We do not have materials for sale here in the shop. \u00a0We are familiar with\n                              area suppliers and can make recommendations and provide contact information. Q: Do you have materials available for students to use for their projects? A: Yes, to a limited degree. \u00a0There are some materials that have been left over from\n                              other student\u2019s projects that we would rather see used than thrown away. \u00a0Those materials\n                              are stored in the shop and are labeled as \u201cAvailable for Student Use\u201d. \u00a0Ask a staff\n                              member to point those out to you. It is preferred that these materials be reserved\n                              for use on school projects, not personal projects. Q: Is there space in the Woodshop where I can store my materials or projects in process? A: There is a limited amount of storage space in the Woodshop. \u00a0You should discuss\n                              your storage needs with a shop staff member and request permission for storage. Q: Do you teach any classes in how to do woodworking? A: No. \u00a0There aren\u2019t any classes in how to do woodworking that are available here\n                              in the shop. The staff is always ready and able to advise you on a project or technique,\n                              so don\u2019t hesitate to ask for our guidance or suggestions. Q: Are you open on the weekend? A: No, we are open Monday-Friday from 9am-10pm during Fall and Spring semester and\n                              Monday-Friday 9am-6pm during the Summer semester. Q: Can I work in the shop during the summer? A: The Woodshop hours during the summer are limited to 9am-6pm. During the summer,\n                              Woodshop staff typically support large construction projects or projects that support\n                              the College but are outside of the shop itself. Therefore, we typically close the\n                              shop to students working on personal projects during the summer unless communication\n                              for special arrangements is made. \u00a0 Q: How do I use the CNC Router? A: Please refer to the CNC Router Fabrication Procedure section for the steps required\n                              to use the CNC. Q: Can I work on personal projects? A: Yes. However, you should always consult with shop staff before starting personal\n                              projects that require use of the wood shop. \u00a0 Q: Do I need to provide my own glue and sandpaper? A: The Woodshop has a limited supply of consumables such as screws, glue and sandpaper\n                              that is available for students to use on school related projects only. Students should\n                              provide all consumables for any work on personal projects. Q: Do you have any tools that can cut metal? A: We are not set up to cut metal in the shop. We do have some hack saws that can\n                              cut limited metal bar or rod. \u00a0 Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

Marietta is interested in sustainable development in architecture and applies those\n                     same ideas to the mentoring of high school students who might be interested in becoming\n                     architects. She attends workshops and lectures on sustainability to broaden her knowledge\n                     of the ever-expanding subject. She participates in various committees, notably Marietta\n                     High School\u2019s Career Path Discovery, Pre-Engineering and Pre-Architecture Boards and\n                     their Engineering Pipeline Extravaganza held twice each year. This helps Marietta\n                     to recruit architecture students from local high schools. To that end, she developed\n                     and ran (since 2014) the Summer Academies for the ACCI SPIKE Studio, an introduction\n                     for middle and high school students to the college courses they will encounter, one\n                     held at Georgia Tech and one at KSU. It has been a resounding success and is ongoing\n                     again after a COVID hiatus. The last year at KSU (2019, before the pandemic), our\n                     Summer Academy students designed homeless shelters and built one to donate to the\n                     Mad Housers group, so that a homeless person now has a place to call home. Marietta\n                     is a firm believer in hands-on learning; Summer Academy students had an introduction\n                     to hand tools and construction techniques that will positively influence the rest\n                     of their lives. She and her colleagues were presented with the AIA Bronze Medal Award\n                     for community outreach later that same year. Volunteer work is at the heart of community participation and involvement. Marietta\n                     feels it is imperative that she give back to the educational and social organizations\n                     which helped to nurture her, so she is delighted to serve on committees like the University\n                     wide Education Abroad Advisory and Standing Committees, and the smaller Department\n                     of Architecture Study Abroad committees over the years. Marietta regularly volunteers\n                     as a docent at the local art museum and reads for conference acceptance and review\n                     for the proceedings of conferences such as NCUR and SESAH. \n                      Zamila Karimi \n                      Zamila Karimi is a Senior Lecturer in the College of Architecture and Construction\n                     Management at Kennesaw State University. She teaches architectural studio and theory\n                     courses, including Thesis, Urban Lab, Tactical Urbanism, and Urban Theory, expanding\n                     her research in the public space. Her work explores the intersection between art, architecture, and design to transform\n                     how we engage with one another to inspire dialogue across cultural, ethnic, and geographic\n                     boundaries in contemporary Public Space.\u00a0 She uses her interdisciplinary background\n                     to question current public spaces as sites of actions, possibilities and promises\n                     through spatial and social justice issues. She believes in the power of design to\n                     build bridges amongst diverse communities and architects/designers\u2019 role as social\n                     agents of change to question the norm, whether through place-making strategies or\n                     addressing challenges around shelter | homelessness. Her numerous temporary interactive\n                     installations within the public space and community organizations nationally and internationally\n                     help disseminate her research. Zamila has collaborated on projects with Atlanta Streets\n                     Alive, Liveable Buckhead, MODA, Trust for Public Land \u2013 City of Atlanta, Modern Atlanta,\n                     City of Clarkston and the Ismaili National Council and Aga Khan Development Network\n                     AKDN.

Brent Scarbrough of Brent Scarbrough & Company was recently honored by the Atlanta\n                              Business Chronicle at the 2020 Most Admired CEOs virtual event.\u00a0 The awards honored\n                              Atlanta based CEOs with a strong record of innovation, outstanding financial performance,\n                              and commitment to diversity in the workplace, who have made significant contributions\n                              to the metro community. Most Admired CEO Brent Scarbrough started his company in 1985\n                              while in his junior year at then Southern Polytechnic State University pursuing a\n                              degree in Bachelor of Science degree in Construction Management.\u00a0 Students from Professor Michael Collins\u2019 CM 3110 Residential and Light Construction\n                              class recently visited one of the Katerra Construction Company\u2019s project sites. Professor\n                              Collins felt his students would gain invaluable insight on the materials and methods\n                              of construction by visiting a construction site and worked with Katerra\u2019s staff to\n                              coordinate the visit. Katerra\u2019s facilitation of the event was well received by the\n                              students. The visit covered everything from site preparation and layout to finish\n                              materials. A presentation on the project, including construction methods, prior to\n                              the site visit enabled the students to put the overall operations occurring at the\n                              site into a clearer context. \u201cI was able to visualize means and methods used on the\n                              site in a much more understandable way\u201d, stated Tim Rauton, one of the students who\n                              attended the event. Another student, Steve Scruggs, expressed, \u201cBeing able to put\n                              eyes on many of the materials in our textbook was quite valuable. It was great to\n                              have the actual real-life work experiences to supplement our classroom learning\u201d.\u00a0 \n                               Carrie Roeger \n                               Carrie Roeger, a part-time faculty in the construction management program, was recently\n                              elected by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).

Its\n                              recent success can be attributed in part to the department\u2019s robust industry advisory\n                              board, Siddiqi said. The board has 42 members \u2013 many of whom are donors \u2013 and its mission is to ensure\n                              students meet the educational and career needs of the industry from an employer\u2019s\n                              perspective. 2019 Diamond Sponsors Day The Diamond Level sponsors of the 2018 Construction Management Industry Advisory Board\n                              Annual Fundraiser Gala were invited to participate in a special career fair held by\n                              the department in February 2019.

Additionally, Abree gave $20,000 to benefit the University\u2019s future construction management\n                              building, with the intent of naming a faculty office within the new structure. To be eligible for the scholarship, the KSU student must also be an undergraduate\n                              enrolled full time with a minimum grade-point average of 3.0. After working at various construction companies around metropolitan Atlanta, Abree\n                              founded United Consulting in 1990 and serves as chief executive officer. Abree, a\n                              registered professional engineer in Georgia, has built Norcross-based United Consulting\n                              into one of the top engineering firms in the area. He earned his Bachelor of Science\n                              in civil engineering technology in Marietta, Georgia, at what was then called Southern\n                              Technical Institute. \u201cThe scholarship gift of Reza Abree will enable KSU students to overcome their financial\n                              difficulty and complete their studies faster,\u201d said Dr. Khalid Siddiqi, interim dean\n                              of the College of Architecture and Construction Management at Kennesaw State. \u201cIt\n                              is alums like Reza who give back to their institution to create another success story,\n                              and this is one way of creating their own legacy.

That all changed when he took an aptitude test during a freshman seminar course which\n                              introduced him to the University\u2019s\u00a0construction management degree program, convincing\n                              him that he could have a future in homebuilding. \u201cIt was a program that was growing tremendously and had deep industry connections,\n                              so it seemed like a natural fit,\u201d said Calhoun, who recently received the Outstanding\n                              Student Award from the  National Association of Home Builders\u00a0(NAHB) . The prestigious award recognizes student members of NAHB based on their academic\n                              standing, involvement with their student chapter and interest in pursuing residential\n                              building. With Calhoun at the helm, the KSU chapter has seen membership grow exponentially in\n                              its five-year history, leading the organization to receive NAHB\u2019s Outstanding Student\n                              Chapter of the Year Award for going the \u201cextra mile\u201d in engaging with local home builders,\n                              the community and the student body. \u201cIt\u2019s really special to receive that kind of recognition,\u201d said Calhoun, who works\n                              part-time for David Weekly Homes while finishing his degree. \u201cWe have a lot of good\n                              industry professionals we connect with and a great core of students who are really\n                              interested in the industry, and the award validates the kind of work we put in to\n                              better ourselves.\u201d For the last three years, Calhoun has also represented KSU\u2019s\u00a0Department of Construction\n                              Management\u00a0in NAHB\u2019s annual student competition, designed to give students the opportunity\n                              to apply their newly acquired skills on a real-life management project. As a team,\n                              the students submit and defend development proposals to a group of construction executives\n                              who act as judges. KSU\u2019s team submitted a 100-page proposal detailing a worksite development and marking\n                              plans similar to that of a professional builder. Out of 37 universities competing\n                              this year, Kennesaw State placed fifth. The student chapter won the three-day competition\n                              in 2017. \u201cThe students who get to participate in this are really able to get a leg up on the\n                              competition when joining the workforce,\u201d Calhoun said. \u201cFor me, it brings together\n                              everything I\u2019m learning in the classroom and has taught me the intricacies of homebuilding\n                              and developing a plan.\u201d Irish Horsey, assistant professor of construction management and advisor to the NAHB\n                              student chapter, said Calhoun\u2019s commitment to the organization was integral to the\n                              team\u2019s success this past year. \u201cMac is a model student,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom spending long nights and weekends to prepare\n                              the team for competition to hosting on campus events, his dedication was stellar.\n                              Mac is on his way to being an exceptional leader having secured positions with leading\n                              residential builders and exceeding employer expectations.\u201d \u00a0 April 23, 2019 On April 17th, the  Associated General Contractors (AGC) KSU student chapter  celebrated their last meeting of the Spring 2019 semester by inviting Kevin Kuntz\n                              (President of Southeast Division McCarthy Building & Outgoing President at AGC of\n                              Georgia) and Mark Woodall (Governmental Affairs at AGC of Georgia) to discuss the\n                              benefits of being an AGC member. Not only does the AGC provide an endless amount of\n                              networking and education opportunities, but the organization also campaigns for the\n                              needs, interests and concerns within the construction industry. During the Fall 2018 \u2013 Spring 2019 school year, the AGC student chapter hosted 12\n                              events. These events included presentations from leading construction industry professionals,\n                              an office visit to JE Dunn Construction and Holder Construction, two volunteer events\n                              at the Goshen Valley Boys Ranch, a Kennestone Hospital site visit and a cookout sponsored\n                              by New South Construction. The student chapter even hosted an AGC hat design contest\n                              and gave away an AGC of Georgia Young Leadership Program (YLP) membership to a KSU\n                              student. There is no doubt the AGC student chapter has been active this school year! The AGC KSU student chapter is also excited to announce that all three AGC scholarships\n                              given in the state of Georgia were awarded to students at Kennesaw State University.\n                              These students are Joe Congemi (Undergraduate Construction Management Major \u2013 Senior),\n                              Addie Thornton (Undergraduate Civil Engineering Major \u2013 Senior), and Misikir Mengistu\n                              (Graduate Construction Management Major- Senior). These students plan to graduate\n                              in 2020. The AGC student chapter had a fantastic year and looks forward to another great year\n                              starting this fall. \u00a0 April 22, 2019 Effective July 1, Dr. Khalid Siddiqi, professor and chair of the Department of Construction\n                              Management, will serve as interim dean following the retirement of Richard Cole this\n                              summer after many years of service.

Designed to provide benchmarking data of the\n                              state\u2019s general contractors and subcontractors, the survey is led by Scott Hazy and\n                              Tom Jollay, co-leaders of Bennett Thrasher\u2019s Construction Practice, along with Khalid\n                              Siddiqi, chair of Kennesaw State University\u2019s Department of Construction Management. Results are based on responses from 149 Georgia-based privately-held construction\n                              companies in categories including compensation, recruiting and retention strategies,\n                              profitability, healthcare costs and benefits, innovation, business challenges and\n                              project backlog. \u201cThe labor shortage has become increasingly acute over the last three years. It\u2019s\n                              no surprise that recruiting and retaining qualified individuals remains the top challenge\n                              for the construction industry,\u201d said Siddiqi. \u201cHowever, it is encouraging to see that\n                              the number of organizations focusing on innovation and technology continue to rise\n                              as we address this significant issue.\u201d \u201cIn our third year of this groundbreaking survey, the number of participating firms\n                              continues to increase. We are excited to have significant benchmarking data available\n                              to show the strength of the construction industry and address the challenges, technology\n                              and best practices that are evolving within the industry,\u201d added Hazy, co-leader of\n                              Bennett Thrasher\u2019s Construction Practice, along with Jollay.

It\u2019s the first playhouse raffle the charity has held in eight years, said HomeAid\n                              executive director Mandy Crater. \u201cWe had such success with the event from 2004-2010 that it is a dream come true for\n                              us to begin construction on this miniature, custom home. We are beyond grateful for\n                              the support and enthusiasm of Paran Homes, KSU, and all of the other donors for making\n                              Project Playhouse\u2019s return a reality in 2018,\u201d she said. \u00a0 Donations will support scholarships and the development of teaching facilities September 24, 2018 In its most successful fundraiser yet, Kennesaw State University\u2019s Department of Construction\n                              Management raised more than $167,000 for scholarships and the development of state-of-the-art\n                              teaching facilities. The 17th Annual Industry Advisory Board Fundraiser Gala, held last week at the Cobb\n                              Energy Performing Arts Centre, drew more than 72 sponsorships from individuals and\n                              organizations. Funds raised this year eclipsed the previous high of $140,000 set in 2017. During\n                              the event, construction management students were awarded $14,500 in scholarships. \u201cWe are so very grateful to see this level of support from our industry partners throughout\n                              the region,\u201d said Khalid Siddiqi, chair of Kennesaw State\u2019s Department of Construction\n                              Management. \u201cThrough their generosity, we are able to lessen the financial burden\n                              of students who wish to receive a world-class education at KSU. I am thrilled to see\n                              how much this event has grown since its inception.\u201d The gala started from humble beginnings, raising just $7,000 in its first year. Its\n                              recent success can be attributed in part to the department\u2019s robust industry advisory\n                              board, Siddiqi said. The board has 42 members \u2013 many of whom are donors \u2013 and its mission is to ensure\n                              students meet the educational and career needs of the industry from an employer\u2019s\n                              perspective.

The event was held at Maggiano\u2019s Little Italy, Cumberland Mall on August 7, 2018.\u00a0\n                              A large cross-section of Atlanta\u2019s construction industry organizations participated.\u00a0 Cynthia Mills, founder and Principal of leadership development consulting group The\n                              Leaders\u2019 Haven, along with Laura Ashby, an experienced litigator with Miller & Martin,\n                              Dr. Khalid Siddiqi, Chair of Kennesaw State University\u2019s Department of Construction\n                              Management, and Margaret Rauber, Vice President of Operations at Winter Construction,\n                              addressed ABC of Georgia members on ways and means of tackling the issue from both\n                              a theoretical and a practical perspective. Dr. Siddiqi shared the results of his research paper \u201cBest Practices for Attracting\n                              and Retaining Female Construction Project Managers\u201d, which he co-authored along with\n                              Kennesaw State MS CM Program Graduate, Casey Stockbridge and Tom Jollay of Bennett\n                              and Thrasher. Their research showed the challenges of not just recruiting women into construction\n                              management but retaining them. \u201cWomen leave the industry at a much higher rate than\n                              men,\u201d Siddiqi explained. \u201cOur research revealed some of the reasons why.\u201d Siddiqi\n                              listed the top 5 key differences between men and women when it comes to views about\n                              their employer. While some of these differences involved common tenets of company\n                              policy, such as anti-sexual harassment policies and alternative work schedules, others\n                              were more surprising (for instance, 82% of males but only 59% of females care about\n                              a company vehicle.) Dr. Siddiqi shared some proven best practices for attracting and\n                              retaining female project managers in construction industry organizations. \u00a0 August 15, 2018 The KSU chapter of the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) is pleased to announce\n                              that the 2018 \u2013 2019 AEE KSU chapter president, Adam Minor, has been chosen to receive\n                              a $4,000 scholarship from the Foundation of the Association of Energy Engineers (FAEE).\n                              Adam was awarded the Albert Thumann scholarship, an award which honors the late founder\n                              and Executive Director of the Association of Energy Engineers, Mr. Albert Thumann.\n                              This scholarship is regarded as the top honored scholarship the Foundation of the\n                              Association of Energy Engineers provides.

In addition to Adam's award, four KSU AEE students were also selected to receive a\n                              $1,000 scholarship from the Foundation of the Association of Energy Engineers. July 24, 2018 The Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) Corporate has announced that the Kennesaw\n                              State University chapter of the Association of Energy Engineers is the recipient for\n                              the 2018 \"Best Student Chapter Meeting\" award for their \"American Wind, Inc.\" meeting\n                              held in February 2018. This award is a national award given by AEE corporate annually. Robert Yost, inventor of the MicroCube mini-turbine, and his son, Dan Yost from American\n                              Wind, visited KSU Marietta to discuss the added benefits that their mini-wind turbines\n                              can offer as compared to large turbines on wind farms. These benefits included increased\n                              renewable energy created in less space with lower wind speeds and the possibility\n                              for wind walls to retract into ground bunkers during bad weather conditions to prevent\n                              product damage. American Wind also discussed topics on magnetism and air turbulence,\n                              and even demonstrated a MicroCube in action. Recently, American Wind, Inc was named\n                              #1 in Energy CIO Insights magazine's \"Top 10 Energy Start Ups\". Read more by clicking\n                               here . With 19 individuals attending, this was the most attended meeting KSU AEE has had\n                              thus far. American Wind also invited KSU students and advisors to visit their headquarters\n                              in Huntsville, AL in the future. Notable attendees at this meeting were Ruth Whitlock,\n                              Executive Administrator at AEE Headquarters, Jacqueline Stephens, KSU AEE Faculty\n                              Advisor, and Dan Shabo and Darrell Sandlin, AEE Georgia Chapter Advisors. The KSU AEE student chapter is so proud to make an impact at Kennesaw State University\n                              by providing students with opportunities to meet with some of the most experienced\n                              professionals in the energy industry. The chapter is especially thankful to all of\n                              the students who attended this meeting, their advisors for helping to connect them\n                              with experienced energy professionals and to all of the individuals who helped to\n                              set up the meeting. \u00a0 June 28, 2018 Construction managers are highly skilled in problem solving and technology use for\n                              efficiency in construction project management best practices. Kennesaw State University\n                              Construction Management students are currently benefiting from the generosity of three\n                              software and technology firms - Bluebeam, Procore and Raken. Bluebeam  has gifted the  department their Revu 2018 software for over 150 CM lab computers. In addition, students\n                              in select CM classes will receive a free download of the software valid for the academic\n                              year. This is the 5th year that Bluebeam has collaborated with our program. In the\n                              classroom, students create PDF documents, markup drawings and prepare quantity take-offs\n                              and estimates. Out of the classroom, Bluebeam Studio allows the students to collaborate\n                              on group projects and competition teams. In a new partnership with  Procore , KSU CM professors are introducing the online Project Management system to our students.\n                              The software, tools and apps will provide the students with training in project management\n                              tasks such as document control, submittals, requests for information and change orders.\n                              Students will also be eligible to receive a digital badge upon completion of the Procure\n                              Student Certification program. Raken  is providing their Daily Reporting App to CM students participating in the summer\n                              internship program. The students use the app to record and report their weekly hours,\n                              as well as document their daily tasks with written descriptions and photographs. Using\n                              this app helps the students to understand the importance of a daily journal for a\n                              construction professional. The CM department is proud to equip our students with fundamental project management\n                              skills and current construction technology. The academic partnerships with firms like\n                              Bluebeam, Procore and Raken help to prepare them for success as future leaders of\n                              the construction industry. \u00a0 May 1, 2018 The KSU Department of Construction Management would like to thank all of those who\n                              participated and contributed toward making the 2018 Sporting Clays Fundraiser a great\n                              success. Twenty six teams with one hundred two shooters participated, almost doubling\n                              the number of participants in 2017. A team of five students, lead by Hank Stricland\u00a0(KSU\n                              AGC Student Chapter President), also participated in the event beside Dr. Siddiqi.\n                              The awards were presented to the winners by Mr. Paul Hogan, past Chair of the Construction\n                              Industry Advisory Board. Student Alumni Relations Committee members present on the\n                              occasion included Cherri Watson, AGC Education Director (Chair), and Chuck Little,\n                              Director Education of Atlanta Electrical Contractors Association.\u00a0 This year's event took place on Friday, April 27th at Garland Mountain Sporting Clays\n                              in Waleska, GA and was organized by\u00a0Cherri Watson (Committee Chair, Student Alumni\n                              Relations of the KSU CM Industry Advisory Board).

Anderson Boys & Girls Club in Marietta. The Student Chapter recently spoke to children in the program on five main sustainability\n                              initiatives including, water usage, food, recycling, energy and power conservation\n                              and solar power technology. They also led hands-on activities, including creating\n                              a solar powered vehicle out of a recycled tin can, and presented a PowerPoint explaining\n                              various sustainability concepts.  Student Chapter participants very much enjoyed having the opportunity to share information\n                              regarding sustainability with the future generation and teach them that despite their\n                              age, they have a role to play and can make a positive impact for the environment. \u00a0 April 25, 2018 Gunjan Garg and Adanegn Woldemichael accompanied Dr. Siddiqi, Chair of the Construction\n                              Management Department KSU, to the  54th ASC Conference  in Minneapolis, MN. The Associated Schools of Construction Conference is the premier\n                              conference for Construction Management discipline where national and international\n                              peer-reviewed papers are presented.  Ms. Garg presented a paper entitled \"EarthCraft Homes Costs more than Conventional\n                              Homes\". The objective of this study was to identify the construction cost differential\n                              between EarthCraft and conventional homes, and included a comparison of projects completed\n                              by the EarthCraft homebuilders and conventional builders. Mr. Woldemichael presented\n                              a paper\u00a0entitled\u00a0\"Unions Electrical Workers are not Against Prefabrication\". The study\n                              identified the best practices for prefabrication feasible for electrical workers who\n                              are part of unions.  Dr. Siddiqi presented\u00a0a paper\u00a0entitled \"Best Practices for Attracting and Retaining\n                              Female Construction Project Managers\" and shared the findings on gender differences\n                              for retaining for construction organizations. The paper was co-authored by Casey Stockbridge,\n                              who graduated in December 2017 from KSU\u2019s Construction Management Graduate Program.\n                              The third author of this study was Tom Jollay from Bennett Thrasher accounting firm. The fourth paper presented by KSU at the conference was\u00a0\"Barriers to Net Zero Housing\n                              in the US\", co-authored with Faiza Mahdi, who is also a graduate of KSU's Construction\n                              Management program and works in the construction industry. The objective of this study\n                              was to identify the major barriers to large-scale adoption of Passive Housing concept\n                              in the United States. \u00a0 April 23, 2018 By Anastaciah Ondieki The last five years have been great for the construction industry with spending at\n                              an all-time high of close to $1.3 trillion. The industry\u2019s growth places a high demand\n                              for a skilled workforce and further reveals a gap in the number of men and women working\n                              in construction. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, women represent only 9 percent of\n                              the total labor force in the construction industry, traditionally viewed as a male\n                              dominated field. Women working in the industry are concentrated mainly in the sales\n                              and office sector with fewer occupying the professional and management sector. Representation\n                              of women on the construction trades side is also low. Economist Andrew Flowers with Indeed Hiring Lab, a team of economists who provide\n                              insights into the labor market said the difference in numbers could be a question\n                              of whether women are interested in the field, or whether companies create a culture\n                              of workplace balance that accommodates women. Flowers says the demand for workers could be an opportunity for women to explore the\n                              thriving industry, because jobs posted are not being filled fast enough. \u201cMore women would be potentially drawn into the construction industry because of how\n                              tight the labor market is,\u201d said Flowers. Flowers says overall construction industry job postings on his team\u2019s website are\n                              at the highest point in six years. The gender gap for women in the construction field is mirrored by the enrollment rates\n                              of female versus male students in technical colleges within the state. Data from the\n                              Technical College System of Georgia shows that last year, only 836 of the 10,730 students\n                              enrolled in construction related courses were female. The biggest problem, according to Professor Khalid Siddiqi, chair of the Construction\n                              Management department at Kennesaw State University\u2019s college of Architecture and Construction\n                              Management, is the lack of exposure of the program at the high school level. \u201cI feel really challenged that I cannot get the message to the schools where these\n                              students are coming from,\u201d Siddiqi said. The number is even worse for women because of age-old roles assigned to women. Last Fall, only 11.6 percent of 388 students enrolled at KSU to pursue a degree in\n                              Construction management were female. Siddiqi however says the school has in the last\n                              five years increased the number of women in the program by 1,000 and hopes to see\n                              the numbers rising. With the growing demand for skilled labor, Siddiqi sees a big opportunity for female\n                              students in the estimation and scheduling professions and the quick absorption of\n                              graduating students into the work force. \u201cNone of our students have to look for a job\u2026they get into full time employment because\n                              they already have the skill sets needed to hit the ground running,\u201dsays Siddiqi of\n                              the ready market for well trained industry workers. The construction jobs prospects in Atlanta and the state in general are reflective\n                              of the booming construction industry nationwide. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the city of Sandy Springs ranked\n                              9th nationwide last year among metropolitan areas employing the highest number of\n                              construction managers in the nation, with 4,690 jobs created at an average hourly\n                              wage of $56.43. The state ranked fourth nationwide among highest paying jobs for construction managers\n                              with the yearly wage at $113,930. The average hourly wage for a construction workers\n                              as of last month was $29.43, according to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics. That, according to Siddiqi is indicative of growing prospects for those interested\n                              in the construction management field. \u201cI see a very strong possibility that females are going to be joining the construction\n                              industry because of not only lucrative pay but the realization that the jobs they\n                              prefer can make a difference in the city\u2019s skylines,\u201d said Siddiqi on the favorable\n                              job prospects. Even in the wake of public outcry over gender pay discrepancies , jobs in the construction\n                              field have the narrowest wage gap with women earning 95.7% of what men get, according\n                              to the U.S. Department of Labor . This is much higher than the median gap of 20%. Some construction companies and developers are involving themselves with ongoing efforts\n                              to bring gender parity in the industry through strategic policies. Kevin Kuntz, President of the Southeast division of McCarthy Building Company Inc.,\n                              which employs close to 2,000 people said his company is committed to diversifying\n                              its workforce to give equal opportunities to all employees to rise through the ranks\n                              based on performance regardless of their gender. \u201cWhen you bring in people of diverse backgrounds, they bring in diverse perspectives\n                              and with diverse perspectives comes very creative ideas and solutions\u201d which Kuntz\n                              says result in better services. According to company data, female employees accounted for 31.5 percent of the new\n                              hires the company took in last year, with most of the jobs in project engineering. Women account for 24% of the total workforce for the company. As data points to continued growth, industry insiders hope that the face of the typical\n                              construction worker also gets to evolve to allow women a chance to tap into the growth,\n                              as well as, the lucrative salaries that accompany the profession. Daphne Bryson Jackson, the co-founder of the Women in Construction, Engineering and\n                              Related Services (WICERS) says having more younger women introduced to STEM-related\n                              courses will help boost the number of women in the field. \u201cThis kind of generation has women who are bold. They come in and go full throttle,\u201d\n                              adds Jackson. Olivia Fru, project manager for a $90 million active adult community being built in\n                              Atlanta was not greeted by a growing economy or thriving construction industry when\n                              she graduated in 2007 from Southern Polytechnic State University. At the time, there\n                              were no jobs, and getting her foot into the door as a project engineer was \u201cvery difficult\u201d. But she hit the ground running when she landed her first job, despite reservations\n                              about her capabilities by one company president. She credits her start in the field\n                              to a vote of confidence on her behalf by a company VP who gave her a chance to prove\n                              her worth. Ten years later and close to 20 projects down, Olivia who is now managing\n                              a multi-million-dollar project where she oversees over 70 sub-contractors, the project\n                              schedule and finances says it has taken wits, hard work and ignoring some stereotypes\n                              to find her footing in the industry. \u201cOver the years I have let my abilities speak for me,\u201d she says adding that she ensures\n                              that those working around her judge her by her abilities rather than the fact that\n                              she is a woman. She is aware of the gap between men and women in the field and hopes for parity in\n                              numbers. \u201cEven with undergrad, it was maybe 5 women in the program,\u201d she said adding that she\n                              has grown accustomed to working in a field where women are minorities. At 31, Fru does not fit the profile of your typical project manager with a general\n                              contracting company. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people my age doing this. Companies are really looking to hire,\u201d she\n                              said of current job market. Her sights are set growing her career to become the vice president of a construction\n                              company some time in the near future. She sees no roadblock to her goals and hopes\n                              to see more women join the lucrative career. \u201cIf more people get used to seeing people in these roles and even higher, then it\n                              becomes normal\u2026\u201d Fru said. \u00a0 April 18, 2018 By Arlinda Smith Broady Construction projects are cropping up all over metro Atlanta as it has emerged from\n                              the Great Recession, but one challenge is filling the demand for workers. Industry leaders say there is a serious shortage of skilled workers, though local\n                              high schools are partnering with businesses, technical colleges and four-year universities\n                              to produce the necessary workforce. High schools throughout the state had already begun adding\u00a0\u201cpathways\u201d to careers\u00a0such\n                              as construction jobs, as well as those that require post-secondary training and college\n                              courses. According to the Construction Education Foundation of Georgia, the state\u2019s\n                              public schools have over 150 skilled-trade construction and metals programs with 17,000-plus\n                              students enrolled. Educators have shifted in the past decade from the idea that everyone graduates from\n                              high school and heads to college. \u201cOur focus now is that everyone graduates with a\n                              plan,\u201d said Kelly Walter, assistant principal at Berkmar High School in Gwinnett County.\n                              \u201cWhether it\u2019s a university, tech school or straight to work, we want students to have\n                              an idea what they want to do when they leave here.\u201d Research shows that not everyone is college material. And with the increased need\n                              for skilled workers, state funding has been allocated to make sure everyone who wants\n                              to learn a trade has the means to do it. A state initiative that went into effect\n                              in January ensures that students who opt for high-demand careers can earn a decent\n                              living without student loans or other educational debt. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\n                              data show that most construction jobs in Georgia pay $30,000 to $75,000 annually. Berkmar has had an architectural and construction pathway for four years. With funding\n                              from the state and county, the school turned the old in-school suspension area into\n                              a wing for architecture, electrical, carpentry and masonry work. This year it will\n                              graduate its first group to complete the cycle, who will be qualified to go straight\n                              to work. \u201cMy main goal is to bring the construction work-site experience to the students and\n                              bring the students to real-life construction companies,\u201d said John Tronolone, construction\n                              academy coach at Berkmar. It\u2019s a traditionally male-dominated industry, so the opportunity to try it out before\n                              graduation appealed to juniors Isis Crossley and April Rodriguez as well as senior\n                              Kenia Gutierrez. \u201cI kind of fell into this by accident and now I know this is what I want to do,\u201d said\n                              Crossley. Rodriguez has a brother in the construction field, and he urged her to give it a try. \u201cHe told me there are many opportunities for women in construction so I wanted to\n                              see for myself.\u201d she said. Gutierrez plans to attend Gwinnett Tech in the fall and wants to somehow incorporate\n                              a construction career with cosmetology. She said she likes the fact that her options\n                              are limitless. The academy partners with\u00a0local businesses that donate money, materials and most importantly\n                              time. \u201cIn order to be competitive in the real world, our students need to see what the real\n                              world is like,\u201d said Tronolone. \u201cThey can go through coursework, but seeing how those\n                              skills they\u2019re learning turn into real buildings makes a lot of difference.\u201d In a survey of construction businesses by accounting firm Bennett Thrasher and the\n                              construction management department at Kennesaw State University released in June,\n                              87 percent of construction firms called the search for skilled workers their top problem. \u201cThe industry is definitely in need of more people,\u201d said Ashton Watt, personnel and\n                              recruiting manager at Eckardt Electric, a company that has more than 80 years in metro\n                              Atlanta specializing in large-scale projects such as hospitals and universities. \u201cWhen\n                              I came on in 2011 we had about 70 employees. We just recently hired our 400th.\u201d \u201cWe have deep roots in the area and we\u2019re looking for ways to grow the next generation,\u201d\n                              said Watt. \u201cA lot of students who want to try their hand at entry-level jobs have\n                              lots of room for advancement.\u201d U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that in 2005 there were 11.5 million workers\n                              in the construction industry, and the unemployment rate hovered around 8.2 percent.\n                              That number dropped to 10.6 million in 2010, and unemployment jumped to 18 percent.\n                              Even though\u00a0employment has improved, the workforce has not rebounded to pre-recession\n                              levels. In 2015, unemployment was 7.1 percent but the construction workforce contracted\n                              further to 10.4 million, according to a report from BuildZoom, a site that focuses\n                              on construction data. In Georgia, the construction industry needs about 15,000 new workers every year \u2014\n                              with half of those in metro Atlanta, according to the BLS. The industry may have an image problem. A recent survey of 18- to 25-year-olds from\n                              the National Association of Home Builders revealed only 3 percent were interested\n                              in construction as a career. Most surveyed wanted a less physically demanding job\n                              and perceived construction as difficult. Scott Shelar, president of the Construction Education Foundation of Georgia, said\n                              most young people have misconceptions of what the industry entails. \u201cConstruction\n                              is more than a guy with a hammer,\u201d said Shelar. \u201cThere is very sophisticated technology\n                              in place. You can\u2019t build something like the Mercedes Benz Stadium without highly\n                              skilled and highly trained workers.\u201d CEFGA recently sponsored its annual Career Expo, which links students and professionals\n                              in construction, utilities, highways, electrical, mechanical, energy, mining and more.\n                              The event also features the SkillsUSA State Championships, a competition that invites\n                              students to showcase their skills in a number of construction-related disciplines.\n                              Another highlight is a job fair with businesses willing to hire 16- and 17-year-olds\n                              as well as recent grads. Several hundred students brought resumes and met with companies,\n                              and virtually all received offers. According to analysis by Construction Industry Resources Inc., one of the most in-demand\n                              construction jobs in Georgia is craft laborer. The current need in the state is 52,783\n                              workers through August 2021. Laborers perform many basic tasks on construction sites\n                              and mostly work full time. Although the pay is at the bottom of the range at about\n                              $30,000, the job has some of the most potential for advancement. Training is available\n                              through technical schools, community colleges, registered apprenticeship programs\n                              and industry training programs. Filling the need for skilled laborers takes a group effort, said Mike Dunham, CEO\n                              of Associated General Contractors of Georgia Inc. \u201cNothing can get done without the construction industry,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to build\n                              the facilities for new business, expand existing businesses, maintain aging buildings\n                              \u2014 construction is linchpin for growing new business and maintaining existing business.\u201d Dunham pointed out that there aren\u2019t enough skilled workers to replace those retiring.\n                              \u201cFor every 4.5 people who retire in the construction industry, there\u2019s just one person\n                              taking their place,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter a while, you don\u2019t have anyone left.\u201d Dunham said there are state initiatives to turn those numbers around. To encourage employers to bring younger workers into the field, HB 402 was passed\n                              in the 2015-2016 legislative session. It allowed companies a reduction in insurance\n                              costs so students 16 or older who are enrolled in work-based program at an accredited\n                              school can work for them. This allowed construction companies especially to employee\n                              youngsters and get them started in a real-world environment. The Hope Career Grant was expanded in January to offer students greater career opportunities\n                              in five of Georgia\u2019s fast-growing industries, increasing the number of programs that\n                              qualify for this grant to 17. Majors in the construction field the grant will now\n                              cover include air conditioning technology, carpentry, construction management, electrical\n                              construction and maintenance, masonry and plumbing. Industries covered by the HOPE Career Grant were identified by Governor Deal\u2019s High-Demand\n                              Career Initiative as strategically important to the state\u2019s economic growth. The grant\n                              is among the many forms of financial assistance available through the Georgia Student\n                              Finance Commission. And it\u2019s never too late. There is no age limit to be eligible for the grant. April 17, 2018 Approximately 250 Construction Management and Architecture students came out to enjoy\n                              the Department of Construction Management's annual Spring Cookout on Thursday, April\n                              12, 2018.

The event was an opportunity for students and faculty of architecture,\n                              engineering and construction programs to connect with NAWIC and create a network of\n                              professional support within the construction industry. The industry panelists consisted\n                              of the NAWIC Atlanta Chapter president and board members who engaged attendees in\n                              an interactive dialogue about the endless opportunities for women in the construction\n                              industry. Guests were impressed with the students, faculty and building programs offered\n                              by KSU. Students and faculty expressed enthusiasm and appreciation for the NAWIC organization,\n                              and all attendees are looking forward to working together to create a more diverse\n                              construction workforce. \u00a0 February 28, 2018 The KSU Department of Construction Management recently attended the 2018  American Council for Construction Education  (ACCE) Industry Advisory Board Event in Tucson, AZ on February 21, 2018. Along with\n                              Dr. Khalid Siddiqi, Department Chair, Industry Advisory Board members, Rodney Smith\n                              (President, Parrish Construction Group), Jeff Shropshire (Vice President, Roadway\n                              Division, C.W.Matthews Contracting) and Donovan Charles (Senior Director of Development,\n                              KSU University Development) attended the event on the department's behalf. The team\n                              received Visiting Team Member Training (MiT), which is a requirement to visit other\n                              programs on behalf of the American Council of Construction Education as a Visiting\n                              Team Member after the initial trainee visit. The goal for attending this event was\n                              for the department to be able to use knowledge gained and training received to improve\n                              the quality of construction education offered for future graduates. February 12, 2018 The Diamond Level sponsors of the 2017 Construction Management  Industry Advisory Board Annual Fundraiser Gala  were invited to participate in a special career fair held by the department on February\n                              7, 2018. The invited 2017 Diamond Sponsors included: These companies had the benefit of meeting all of the interested construction management\n                              students and recent graduates in a small setting, allowing them to have extended one-on-one\n                              time with each student. The Construction Management Department ensured that all CM\n                              students aspiring for an internship or a full-time position had the opportunity to\n                              come to the event so there will be a wide variety of applicants to suit the needs\n                              of recruiting organizations. This year\u2019s upcoming Annual Fundraiser Gala is scheduled to take place on September\n                              20, 2018. For information on sponsorship opportunities for the 2018 event will be\n                              announced on the  webpage  once available. \u00a0 January 31, 2018 Dr. Khalid Siddiqi, Chair of Kennesaw State University\u2019s Department of Construction\n                              Management, shared a presentation for the Construction Management program with 80\n                              CEOs and CFOs from premier construction firms in Georgia. The Lunch and Learn Session\n                              was held on January 30, 2018 at Maggianos, Cumberland Mall.  He presented recruiting options and strategies that require a commitment at the corporate\n                              level of the organization and forming relationships with universities. \u201cThe most important area that continues to stand out in both the 2016 and 2017 survey\n                              outcomes is recruiting and retention strategies used by organizations. It\u2019s the human\n                              capital which is linked to profitability, compensation and technology.\" Dr. Siddiqi further stated, \u201cMost organizations at present would not consider approaching\n                              a client acquisition strategy without a clear value proposition, segmentation, profitable\n                              fee structure, collateral, sales approach and brand. Yet, when it comes to talent\n                              acquisition, we tend to abandon strategy and focus on the immediate need and/or technical\n                              resumes.\u201d According to Dr. Siddiqi, acquiring and retaining talent is actually no different\n                              from acquiring and retaining clients. You need to develop a strategy, filter through\n                              an unwavering culture, and execute with a strong marketing approach. This presentation was previously made before a national audience (ACCE IAB Best Practices)\n                              for a workshop in Orlando, Florida in February 2017. Dr. Siddiqi cited co-presenters\n                              Rodney Smith, President of Parrish Construction, and Paul Hogan, President of Hogan\n                              Construction Group. He presented a strong marketing approach toward hiring and retention\n                              of construction professionals. These two individuals have a corporate policy at their\n                              organization level to acquire and retain talent. These are not the only organizations\n                              with a corporate level commitment; there are some others who also have a well-defined\n                              and articulated talent acquisition strategy. However, based on his personal experience\n                              and interactions, he finds that most organizations do not have talent acquisition\n                              as a core value and he highly recommends that they make a corporate development plan\n                              for talent acquisition as a value proposition to attract and retain the best and the\n                              brightest. He also suggested a creation of \u201cstate of the art facilities\u201d that can cater to the\n                              strong demand for project managers and project engineers needed in various sectors\n                              of the construction industry. These sectors include highway construction, electrical\n                              and mechanical contractors engaged in all types of building, developers, general contractors,\n                              facility managers and homebuilders. Recently, 154 construction companies responded to an online survey. The results were\n                              presented by Scott Hazy and Tom Jollay, Bennett Thrasher\u2019s Construction Practice co-leaders,\n                              along with a corporate development update by Dr. Khalid Siddiqi. The purpose of gathering\n                              this info was to provide specific bench marking data of the state of Georgia\u2019s general\n                              contractors and subcontractors. The number of participants were nearly doubled from\n                              the previous year\u2019s study. Georgia is home to 9,600 privately held construction companies.

Major takeaways from the survey include: Salaries were up an average of 5.2 percent: January 5, 2018 \n                               \u00a0 Construction management graduate to become third-generation contractor December 14, 2017 As a child, Chase West meandered down the halls of the former Southern College of\n                              Technology with his father, Eddie, chatting with professors and admiring the numerous\n                              awards that lined the brick walls as they walked. At the time, Eddie West wanted to show his son the place where he learned his craft,\n                              long before becoming an electrical contractor and starting A. West Enterprise in Albany,\n                              Ga., with his wife, Angie. He never anticipated that his son would follow him and\n                              his father-in-law to become a third-generation contractor. After graduating this month\n                              with a degree in\u00a0construction management, Chase West will join his father\u2019s company\n                              as a project manager. \u201cIf his granddaddy was alive, he would be so excited and so proud to see his work\n                              continue on,\u201d said Eddie West, a 1994 graduate of Southern Tech, now Kennesaw State\n                              University. However, the path to graduation was somewhat of a journey, Chase West said. After\n                              graduating high school, he enrolled in Darton State College, now Albany State University,\n                              and later took a break from school to try his hand at law enforcement. He joined the\n                              Albany Police Department in 2013 after completing the police academy. \u201cI started policing because I wanted to be sure that construction was something I\n                              wanted to do and not just something my dad wanted me to do,\u201d West said. After a three-year stint as a patrolman, West began to reflect on the times his father\n                              brought him into the construction management capstone room to show the work of students\n                              who would soon graduate and \u201cmake some real money.\u201d He decided it was time to put\n                              down the badge and return to the place that gave his father a fresh start. \u201cMy dad has always taken me up to this campus year after year and made me walk these\n                              halls, made me look at the plaques on the walls,\u201d West said. \u201cHe was very proud of\n                              the education he received. When I finally made it back up here myself, the first thing\n                              I wanted to do was chase his legend down.\u201d Carrying over credits he earned at Darton State, West completed his degree in just\n                              two years, averaging about 15 credit hours per semester. Like his father, he served\n                              as the student chapter president for the Association of General Contractors and was\n                              named chairman for the University\u2019s Construction Guild. He was active in the student\n                              government association as a senator representing the College of Architecture and Construction\n                              Management, and was initiated into the National Honor Society of Leadership and Success. \u201cChase has an impressive personality and is an avid listener. He stands firm on his\n                              ground but also has a soft side, and is always ready and willing to help others,\u201d\n                              said Khalid Siddiqi, chair of KSU\u2019s construction management department. \u201cSeveral construction\n                              companies approached me to recruit Chase, but he politely declined because he made\n                              a commitment to his dad to work only after completing his degree program.\u201d Though he had some field experience working alongside his father, West said he felt\n                              being involved with the various student organizations gave him a new perspective on\n                              project management. He credits the construction management faculty with continuing\n                              to push him academically. \u201cThe professors are all extremely friendly and extremely helpful, and I\u2019m not just\n                              saying that,\u201d West said. \u201cThey all know my name, and they\u2019ve all gone out of their\n                              way to help me any way that they can.\u201d Eddie West jokes that his son couldn\u2019t graduate fast enough, as construction managers\n                              are a need for his company and others across the country. According to the Associated\n                              General Contractors of America, 48 percent of contractors nationwide say they have\n                              trouble filling salaried project manager positions, which include construction managers.\n                              In Georgia alone, more than half of survey respondents said project managers were\n                              their greatest need. Speaking from his own experience, Eddie West said that his son should be well equipped\n                              for the job on Day 1. \u201cI know Chase is getting a quality education because it\u2019s pretty much the same education\n                              I received two decades ago,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun to see him go through\n                              school and to call me to talk about what he\u2019s learning because I\u2019ve done it all before.\u201d \u00a0 November 9, 2017 Carl Frinzi, who was nominated by Dr. Khalid Siddiqi, Chair of the The KSU Department\n                              of Construction Management, was recently honored with the 2017 KSU \"Distinguished\n                              Alumni\" award. Frinzi possesses a B.S. in Civil Engineering Technology from the former Southern Polytechnic\n                              State University\u2019s College of Technology and currently holds the role of Vice President\n                              of\u00a0Batson-Cook, a highly recognized leader in the general contracting industry. Frinzi's multitude of contributions over the past ten years to both the CM Department,\n                              and University as a whole, have significantly impacted students in so many ways. Some\n                              of these\u00a0contributions include: arranging field trips to his projects for students,\n                              providing guest lectures, providing many internship opportunities, offering permanent\n                              job placements to graduates and\u00a0creating an endowed scholarship. Last year, Frinzi\n                              was awarded \"Recruiter of the Year\" by the Construction Management Department, as\n                              Batson-Cook recruited the highest number of CM\u00a0interns and graduates. In addition to his direct impact on the CM Department, Frinzi also played a key role\n                              in the consolidation of SPSU with KSU, and has served on both Foundation boards. He\n                              currently serves\u00a0as a trustee of the Kennesaw State University Foundation. The Department couldn't be more thankful to Frinzi for his continuous generosity in\n                              the form of knowledge, leadership, time, financial contributions, and most of all,\n                              dedication to our students\u00a0and growth of our programs. We are beyond honored to call\n                              him an invaluable member of the CM Industry Advisory Board.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 October 13, 2017 KSU juniors and officers of the Association of Energy Engineers (AEE) student chapter,\n                              Addie Thornton (President, Civil Engineering major and Construction Management minor)\n                              and Adam Minor (Vice President, Construction Management major with a concentration\n                              in Land Development), recently attended the World Energy Engineering Congress (WEEC),\n                              held at the Georgia World Congress Center September 27-29, 2017, where they each were\n                              presented with a $1,000 AEE scholarship and had the opportunity to meet former President\n                              George W. Bush. Adam is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served under President Bush. The KSU AEE student chapter is an organization which enables students to promote the\n                              scientific and educational interests in the fields sustainability and energy by offering\n                              informational meetings with industry professionals, scholarships, internships, conferences\n                              and certification opportunities. Addie and Adam have worked diligently to grow the new student chapter, which began\n                              in October 2016, under the supervision of their advisor, Prof. Jacqueline Stephens,\n                              with additional guidance from Darrel Sandlin and Dan Shabo from the local Georgia\n                              AEE chapter. The student chapter already has an impressive twenty three members and has held eleven\n                              events, including presentations from energy professionals, organization fairs and\n                              an international student chapter luncheon. Student chapter members are also welcome\n                              to attend the local AEE Georgia chapter monthly speaker meetings. On October 16th KSU AEE will tour the Dekalb County Landfill to learn about how methane\n                              gas can be converted to energy.

In fact, according to USGBC.com, college students are currently\n                              seeking\u00a0jobs in sustainability at a rapidly increasing rate. Consider the following:\u00a0 In order to provide students with the education and experience they need to best prepare\n                              for careers in sustainability, the \u00a0 Center for Green Schools at\u00a0USGBC \u00a0 created LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Lab. Students involved\n                              in the LEED Lab pursue the assessment of on-campus\u00a0building(s) and culminate their\n                              studies with the submittal of actual certification documents, allowing the campus\n                              building to become certified and recognized\u00a0for greater environmental performance.\u00a0\u00a0The\n                              result of the lab is a more informed and experienced graduate with experience in the\n                              built sciences and an\u00a0improved campus environment with healthier buildings and sites\n                              for everyone. In Georgia, the passage of House Bill 255 prohibits any publicly funded building to\n                              pursue LEED performance ratings. Although the bill perhaps\u00a0did not intend to impact\n                              curriculum and teaching in public universities, the collateral damage undeniably includes\n                              one of the most inventive and effective\u00a0sustainable teaching programs in the nation,\n                              the LEED Lab. Authored by USGBC, the LEED Lab engages students with dynamic, real-world,\n                              learning\u00a0opportunities based upon the LEED rating system.\u00a0 Luckily for KSU College of Architecture and Construction Management students, they\n                              have the innovative\u00a0and determined minds of professors Ed Akins\u00a0(Architecture) and\n                              Brandi Williams (Construction Management). Since Bill 255 prohibits seeking LEED certification\n                              on the publicly funded KSU campus,\u00a0professors Akins and Williams came up with the\n                              brilliant idea of creating a LEED Lab for KSU students that would allow them to work\n                              with a building off-campus. They reached out to Susan Kidd, Executive Director of\n                              the Center for Sustainability at Agnes Scott College (ASC), a privately funded college\n                              in\u00a0Decatur, Georgia, to initiate a partnership that would allow KSU students the opportunity\n                              to participate in LEED Lab at an alternative location. For additional information on the partnership and how it benefits both KSU and Agnes\n                              Scott College, please refer to Professor Akins article \u00a0 here. \"As a student, the LEED Lab is such an enriching experience.

The Forum was truly an incredible experience for the students, who were so thankful\n                              for the opportunity to network with other students and professionals from all over\n                              the country. They were also introduced to new technologies being utilized in the field\n                              in relation to MEP (mechanical, electrical, and plumbing) specialties.\u00a0 The student group participated in a mini-competition, which gave them the opportunity\n                              to put their skills and knowledge to the test as a team. While attending the Forum,\n                              the team also participated in a career fair, visited the NCAA Museum and attended\n                              serval lectures from professionals that gave the students an insight into what it\n                              would be like to work for a mechanical contractor and learn about where the industry\n                              and related technology is headed. KSU's MCAA team will compete in the Student Chapter Competition at the 2018 MCAA Convention\n                              in San Antonio, TX March 25 - 29, where the challenge will be to plan a project involving\n                              the renovation of the mechanical systems of a Brazilian restaurant in mid-town New\n                              York City\u2014Fogo De Chao Steakhouse.

The 16th\u00a0Annual Industry Advisory Board Fundraiser Gala, held last week at the Cobb\n                              Energy Performing Arts Centre, drew more than 50 sponsorships from individuals and\n                              organizations. Funds raised this year were more than 19 percent higher than in 2016,\n                              and are a far cry from the $7,000 raised at the inaugural gala in 2001. Five students\n                              were each awarded $2,000 scholarships at this year\u2019s event. \u201cProspective students and their parents are attracted to state-of-the-art teaching\n                              facilities and scholarship opportunities, both of which are high on our list of priorities,\u201d\n                              said Khalid Siddiqi, chair of Kennesaw State\u2019s\u00a0Department of Construction Management.\n                              \u201cI am extremely proud to see the success of the 2017 gala, and I\u2019m impressed to see\n                              the growth of this event since inception.\u201d The gala\u2019s success can be attributed in part to the department\u2019s robust industry advisory\n                              board, Siddiqi said. The board has 42 members \u2013 many of whom were also donors for\n                              the fundraising gala \u2013 and its mission is to ensure students meet the educational\n                              and career needs of the industry from an employer\u2019s perspective. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the average salary for construction managers\n                              in 2016 was $89,300, with a bachelor\u2019s degree being the most common entry-level education.\n                              Employment is projected to grow by 5 percent from 2014 to 2024, the agency said. According to the Associated General Contractors of America, however, 48 percent of\n                              contractors nationwide say they have trouble filling salaried project manager positions,\n                              which include construction managers. In Georgia alone, more than half of respondents\n                              said project managers were their greatest need. Kennesaw State\u2019s program offers both bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in construction\n                              management, along with certificate programs in project management, land development,\n                              special construction and facility management. Graduates maintain a near perfect job\n                              placement rate, Siddiqi said. July 28, 2017 For Myles Cardenas, high school basketball meant everything to him and defined him\n                              in many ways. \u201cMy social life had been built around basketball,\u201d said Cardenas, who played four\n                              years of varsity basketball in high school. \u201cI had to recreate myself when I came\n                              here.\u201d Determined to make the most of his college experience when he arrived to campus in\n                              2014, Cardenas, who graduated this summer with a bachelor\u2019s degree in\u00a0construction\n                              management, embraced campus life. He joined student organizations, focused intently\n                              on his studies and made time for a little intramural basketball. \u201cMy days used to be filled with school and basketball, and because I wasn\u2019t playing\n                              anymore, I knew that I could be working and doing other things,\u201d he said. Cardenas made a conscious effort to bring the lessons he learned on the basketball\n                              court to every aspect of his life, inside and outside the classroom. That strategy\n                              earned him top honors from a national professional organization, recognition as Kennesaw\n                              State\u2019s Student of the Year, and employment with two prominent construction companies\n                              while attending KSU. During his first year as a construction management major, Cardenas joined the\u00a0National\n                              Association of Home Builders of KSU, the student chapter of the national professional\n                              organization. \u201cI really blossomed with the NAHB chapter,\u201d he said. \u201cI started in 2014 as a presenting\n                              member of the team at competition, then VP and finally, my senior year as president.\u201d Cardenas led the 2017 KSU team to sweep the competition at the International Builder\u2019s\n                              Show, taking first in the nation for the\u00a0NAHB Student Chapters Residential Construction\n                              Management Competition\u00a0for four-year programs. \u201cThe competition is a lot of work, but it is the most rewarding experience that I\n                              have ever been a part of,\u201d he said. Cardenas also was honored with NAHB\u2019s Outstanding\n                              Student Award. Being involved with teams has been a huge part of Cardenas\u2019 success. He served as\n                              VP of the\u00a0Golden Key International Honour Society, was a member of the\u00a0National Society\n                              of Leadership and Success, and was inducted into\u00a0The Honor Society of Phi Kappa Phi. This spring, the Division of Student Affairs named Cardenas as\u00a0Student of the Year.\u00a0 \u201cMyles Cardenas is an exceptional KSU student and contributes in a variety of ways\n                              to improve campus life for his fellow students,\u201d said Kathy Alday, assistant vice\n                              president for student affairs. Before coming to Kennesaw State, Cardenas attended a small private college in Kansas\n                              to follow his dream of playing college basketball. After a demanding athletic schedule\n                              and rarely seeing his family, Cardenas returned to his hometown of Conyers, Georgia\n                              at the end of his first year. His family, in anticipation of their son\u2019s return, scouted out the best school in\n                              the state for him to study architecture and discovered the former Southern Polytechnic\n                              State University. \u201cEven as a young kid, I was always interested in the designs of buildings,\u201d Cardenas\n                              said, who came to the Marietta Campus in Fall 2014. \u201cArchitecture is where I thought\n                              I wanted to be.\u201d Cardenas had attended a vocational high school for two years to focus on architecture\n                              and construction trades. On advice from mentors and former teachers, Cardenas explored\n                              KSU\u2019s construction management program and ways to build his experience in the field. An ambitious student, he attended the university\u2019s career fair his first semester\n                              and soon landed a position with\u00a0Batson-Cook Construction, a Southeast general contractor,\n                              where he worked for nearly two years. \u201cWhat I admire most about Myles is his persistence and ability to rebound,\u201d said Khalid\n                              Siddiqi, chair of the construction management program. \u201cMyles was a part of KSU NAHB\n                              team that placed 23rd\u00a0in 2014, 10th\u00a0in 2015 and first in 2016. That says a lot about\n                              his character and resilience, which coupled with his humility makes him a favorite.\u201d While attending national NAHB competitions, professionals and organizations looking\n                              to hire sought out top students like Cardenas. After interviewing with a national\n                              home builder at the national competition in early 2016, Cardenas accepted an internship\n                              in land development, his academic concentration within the University\u2019s construction\n                              management program. \u201cI\u2019ve been able to see the industry from a different vantage point in this internship,\u201d\n                              said Cardenas, who has worked for\u00a0CalAtlantic Homes\u00a0in Atlanta for the past year.\n                              \u201cIt\u2019s great having people who want me to shadow them so that I can learn as much as\n                              I can.\u201d What hooked Cardenas on construction management initially was the collaborative, team\n                              effort involved in the field, he explained. \u201cConstruction Management is about managing the building process,\u201d he said. \u201cWe aren\u2019t\n                              necessarily builders, nor do we tell the architects how to design, but we do ensure\n                              that the facility is structurally sound and we manage how to do that. \u201cIt\u2019s estimating and project management and controlling the project from start to\n                              finish. We work together with architects and engineers as one big team.\u00a0 \u201cFor me, it all goes back to basketball. I loved being on a team and that team mentality\n                              is what made me choose construction management in the first place,\u201d he said. June 29, 2017 KSU President, Sam Olens, spoke at a breakfast meeting with construction industry\n                              leaders in the State of Georgia on June 29th at The Georgian Club. In addition to\n                              the leadership of the KSU Construction Management Industry Advisory Board, KSU Foundation\n                              Board members and leadership of the College of Architecture and Construction Management\n                              were also present during the meeting.\u00a0AGC of Georgia, ABC Georgia, Atlanta Electrical\n                              Contractors Association and a large number of Presidents and CEO's of various construction\n                              organization participated in the event. The meeting was organized by Beth Lowry, Chair of the Building and Technology Committee\n                              of the Board. President Olens shared with participants his commitment to the New Construction\n                              Manage ment building program and the importance of the CM program for the state of Georgia.\n                              KSU is one of only two universities in the State of Georgia to offer an undergraduate\n                              degree in Construction Management and the only one in the metro Atlanta area.\u00a0 A Steering Council was formed to promote the goals of the Building and Technology\n                              Committee. The Steering Council includes Tommy Holder (Holder Construction), Millard\n                              Choate (Choate Construction), Randy Hall (Batson-Cook) and Don Davidson (Inglett and\n                              Stubbs). Tommy Holder and Don Davidson also spoke on the occasion. Beth Lowry of Holder\n                              Construction Company agreed to serve as the Secretary to the Council.\u00a0 The committee\u2019s\n                              purpose is to promote the project and assist the KSU Development team with strategic\n                              approaches to reach out to potential donors. \u00a0 May 31, 2017 When a massive fire caused the collapse of an Interstate 85 bridge in Atlanta on March\n                              30, Jeff Shropshire (Civil Engineering Technology, \u201990) dropped what he was doing\n                              and headed into the office. The senior vice president at  C.W. Matthews Contracting Company , the state\u2019s largest road construction contractor, knew his company\u2019s expertise may\n                              be needed. Within hours, the Georgia Department of Transportation had reached out\n                              to them, and soon after, C.W. Matthews\u2019 crews were on site. \u201cOur major projects division crews were working on the  I-85  express toll lanes nearby when the I-85 bridge fell, so we were able to get our crews\n                              out there quickly,\u201d Shropshire said. Relocating crews proved beneficial as traffic\n                              needed to be rerouted with the interstate\u2019s closure. Shropshire was responsible for coordinating the efforts with  GDOT , and began immediately working on logistics and figuring out construction costs.\n                              In his role, he monitored the overall project. \u201cOn the front-end, logistics was a big part of it. We quickly moved in traffic control\n                              equipment,\u201d said Shropshire, who has been with C.W. Matthews for nearly 29 years.\n                              \u201cAnd once we figured out construction costs, we were able to step back and let the\n                              bridge crew do their job.\u201d More than 640 feet of the I-85 bridges, including the 100-foot long burned-out section,\n                              was replaced in six weeks, months ahead of schedule. It re-opened to traffic in both\n                              directions on May 13. \u201cEverything that we wanted to do went well with the subcontractors and suppliers,\u201d\n                              he said, adding there were no project setbacks. \u201cSuppliers had the bridge beams casted\n                              by day four. The timing worked out perfectly.\u201d I-85 bridge Eleven crews worked around the clock \u2013 six crews during the day and five at night\n                              \u2013 during the six-week project. Shropshire oversaw two key division managers, one a\n                              day supervisor and one a night supervisor, in monitoring the 24/7 construction. \u201cIt was an all-hands-on-deck project, and even if nothing was going on, you wanted\n                              to be there and be a part of it,\u201d Shropshire said. \u201cBuilding the bridge was just standard\n                              construction, using the same means and methods that we normally use for all of our\n                              projects.\u201d However, impeccable timing, high-tech materials and good weather landed them ahead\n                              of schedule. C.W. Matthews has 26 bridge crews, but could handpick crews from other\n                              construction projects that were ahead of schedule or nearly complete. The $16.5 million I-85 bridge repair spanned six sections, and the company was able\n                              to stage the project so that crews worked in a stair-step fashion. As soon as columns\n                              were installed on a bent, the crews were able to cap it and move on in sequential\n                              order to complete each section of the bridge, Shropshire explained. The concrete mix was also a project timesaver, he said. Instead of the standard concrete\n                              mix used in road construction, which takes about 14 days to dry and set up, a more\n                              advanced concrete sped dry time to about three days. As crews rebuilt the bridge, which carries nearly a quarter million vehicles each\n                              day, GDOT\u2019s Traffic Management Center gathered data on traffic flow. The C.W. Matthews\n                              company was able to make traffic adjustments overnight. \u201cIn one case, we had the task of changing turn lanes, from one to two lanes, based\n                              on the traffic data studies,\u201d said Shropshire. \u201cWe shut down sections of the road\n                              overnight, restriped it, and had traffic moving again by the next morning.\u201d Shropshire landed a co-op with C.W. Matthews in college and joined the company full-time\n                              after graduating. He earned a degree in civil engineering technology with a construction\n                              option in 1990 from then Southern College of Technology (which was renamed Southern\n                              Polytechnic State in 1996 and then consolidated with Kennesaw State in 2015). Shropshire has remained connected to the university and currently serves on Kennesaw\n                              State\u2019s Industry Advisory Board for Construction Management and chairs the resource\n                              mobilization committee. Last year, he organized the department\u2019s annual fundraising\n                              gala, helping to raise nearly $120,000 for the department\u2019s programs, student scholarships\n                              and student competition teams. He will chair the annual gala again this year. In the days and weeks that followed the bridge collapse, Shropshire said that all\n                              normal business was pushed to a later date, and life as he knew it, including his\n                              volunteer involvement with KSU, was temporarily put on hold. While he was excited to work on a project of such magnitude and has enjoyed the success\n                              of the I-85 bridge reconstruction project, he\u2019s happy to get back to normal. \u201cAny project that is this high profile, the energy levels are so high,\u201d Shropshire\n                              said, adding that the company completed an airport runway project in 33 days. \u201cWe\n                              run at 90 miles per hour and then it all just stops when the project is finished.\n                              Those energy levels are gone and we just go back to our everyday normal operations.\u201d May 19, 2017 Article from  citybizlist.com The Georgia Construction Outlook Survey indicates that 86 percent of the state\u2019s privately\n                              held construction companies project a revenue increase over the prior year.

Please\n                              be aware that acceptance to many of our majors involves some additional steps either\n                              prior to or in addition to declaring your intent to change majors. Please carefully\n                              read the information about your intended major/degree prior to proceeding, and review\n                              the next section \"Declare a Major.\"\u00a0 The School of Art & Design offers\u00a0six\u00a0degree programs, three minor programs, and one\n                                       certificate program for aspiring artists, historians, and teachers:\u00a0 If you are interested in pursuing either the B.F.A. or the B.S., you must apply directly\n                                       to the School of Art & Design and submit a portfolio of your work. Please note that\n                                       as these are professional degree programs, the earlier you begin your course of study,\n                                       the better. Do not wait to complete your General Education coursework before applying,\n                                       as it is unusual that students can complete these degrees in less than three years\n                                       from the time of acceptance to the major. There are specific deadlines by which you must submit your portfolio, and it is important\n                                       that you submit your portfolio as early in your college career as possible. At the\n                                       same time that you submit your portfolio, you can also request credit for studio art\n                                       courses based on courses taken at another college or university. Carefully review\n                                       the information on the School of Art & Design website before you submit your portfolio: Art Admission Information\u00a0 If you are interested in B.A. in Art History, you may declare the major by filling\n                                       out a form in the School of Art and Design Office, or by requesting it through  Owl Express.

{"pageid": "-4850941126336514306", "url": "https://coles.kennesaw.edu/about/michael-j-coles.php", "title": "About Our Benefactor - Coles College of Business", "body": "Coles College of Business Resources For Michael J. Coles is an Atlanta business executive, serial entrepreneur, education\n                     advocate, philanthropist, respected public speaker, and the namesake of the Coles\n                     College of Business at Kennesaw State University. He embodies everything that the\n                     Coles College of Business aspires to instill in its students.\n                   After more than 19 years in the clothing business, Michael J. Coles founded the Great\n                     American Cookie Company in Atlanta in 1977 with his partner, Arthur Karp. They took\n                     an $8,000 investment and grew it into the largest cookie store franchise in the United\n                     States.\n                   Michael\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit ignited long before he opened that first cookie store\n                     in Perimeter Mall. During his nearly two-decade career in the clothing industry, Michael\n                     launched two separate businesses. The first was a chain of retail stores selling discounted\n                     brand-name clothing (a novel concept at the time), and the second was a young-men\u2019s\n                     manufacturing company fittingly named The Great American Clothing Company.\n                   It was a desire to spend more time with his growing family that led him to leave behind\n                     the clothing business. \u201cI was traveling a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cNot just around the U.S.\n                     At that time all clothing manufacturing was moving to Asia. I would be gone for two\n                     to three weeks at a time. I had young children at home and I was looking at industries\n                     that would allow me to stay near them. I called it a forced pivot.\u201d Coles\u2019s story of personal perseverance is as impressive as his business acumen. Six\n                     weeks after opening his first cookie store, he was nearly killed in a motorcycle accident.\n                     A small rock lodged in the bike\u2019s chain, the rear wheel locked up, and he was thrown\n                     from the motorcycle into a telephone pole. Doctors told him that he would never walk\n                     again unaided.\n                   Nine months later, his youngest daughter, Taryn, challenged him to a race to the mailbox.\n                     Unable to run with her, he realized that his recovery was not progressing. Never one\n                     to give up, he started a self-styled rehabilitation program that began with a rusty,\n                     yellow Schwinn bicycle.\n                   After years of training, he went on to set world records in three transcontinental\n                     bicycle races in 1982, 1984, and 1989. He still holds the record for riding from Savannah\n                     to San Diego in 11 days, 8 hours, and 15 minutes as well as the four-man team record\n                     from Los Angeles to New York in 5 days 1 hour 8 minutes. His time on the bike transformed\n                     his approach to business. \u201cMy accident, which is something that could have been a\n                     real tragedy in my life, in fact turned out to be a real triumph,\u201d Michael says. He\n                     used what he learned in his recovery to nurture his entrepreneurial grow Great American\n                     Cookies, which he sold in 1998.\n                   Michael Coles in the 1984\u00a0Spirit of America Ride In 2003, he took the helm at Caribou Coffee Company and more than doubled the size\n                     of the company, opened a commercial sales division and an international market, and\n                     took it public on NASDAQ under the symbol CBOU in 2005. Today, he serves as chairman\n                     of Brand Holding Company and Brand Bank.\n                   Coles\u2019s commitment to community service led him to run for the House of Representatives\n                     against Newt Gingrich in 1996 and the U.S. Senate against Paul Coverdell in 1998,\n                     the same year he sold Great American Cookies.\n                   For the next four years, he chaired the Georgia Film Commission and served on the\n                     University System of Georgia Board of Regents, the Kennesaw State University Foundation\n                     Board, and the Walker School Board. Michael has been deeply involved in a wide variety\n                     of nonprofit philanthropic organizations.\n                   He is currently president of Hillels of Georgia, which supports the Jewish student\n                     community in college campuses, and explained: \u201cI currently spend the majority of my\n                     nonprofit time working there,\u201d he says, adding, jokingly, \u201cI\u2019m on the fifth year of\n                     my two-year term.\u201d Michael and his wife, Donna, have also supported the American Lung\n                     Association, Georgia Special Olympics, Scottish Rite Children\u2019s Medical Center, and\n                     the March of Dimes.\n                   Michael\u2019s relationship with Kennesaw State University began in 1990 when he joined\n                     the school\u2019s board of trustees. Having previously met then-President Betty Siegel\n                     through his involvement in the Cobb Chamber of Commerce, Michael was aware of Kennesaw\n                     State\u2019s growing influence and was eager to help it continue expanding. \u201cI got involved in KSU because everything about the school then and today is very\n                     entrepreneurial,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are always focused on what they can do to give their\n                     students \u2013 their customers \u2013 the best possible education and life experiences. The\n                     one thing I do know is customer experience. I wanted to help the school continue to\n                     enhance their customer service.\u201d\n                   Michael quickly took an interest in the School of Business, which was nicknamed \u201cEntrepreneurial\n                     U\u201d by Dean Tim Mescon, and became a frequent guest lecturer. In 1994, through his\n                     Coles-Novak Family Foundation, Michael endowed the business school with a generous\n                     gift. In appreciation, the following year Kennesaw State renamed the business school\n                     the Michael J. Coles School of Business (now College of Business).\n                   In 1998, the college awarded Michael with the Beta Gamma Sigma Medallion of Entrepreneurship.\n                     The next year he received an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters. He was also a 2015\n                     inductee into the Coles College Hall of Fame. Michael remains a member of the KSU\n                     Foundation Executive Committee.\n                   Today, Michael mentors entrepreneurs and actively lectures about business, giving\n                     more than 75 talks a year at universities and corporate events nationwide. He is the\n                     co-author of the children\u2019s book,  The Land of the Caring Bou , with his wife, Donna, and co-wrote his autobiography,  Time to Get Tough: How Cookies, Coffee, and a Crash Led to Success in Business and\n                        Life,  with Dr. Catherine M. Lewis, Assistant Vice President of Museums, Archives & Rare\n                     Books at Kennesaw State University. The book was published in fall 2018.\n                   Michael Coles with Dr. Catherine Lewis In 2021, Michael and Donna contributed $1 million to Kennesaw State University to\n                     establish the\u00a0The Michael J. and Donna N. Coles Veterans Scholarship Endowment Fund,\n                     which makes scholarships available to veterans who have exhausted their GI Bill\u00ae benefits\n                     before completing their degrees.\n                   \u201cDonna and I are so honored to make this gift to KSU,\u201d Michael says. \u201cMilitary veterans\n                     have always had a special place in our hearts. When I ran for the U.S. Senate in 1998,\n                     I made many friends in the military and was saddened to learn how little the government\n                     does for them. This is our way to honor their sacrifice by offering some help for\n                     a better life.\u201d\n                   Michael\u2019s life has not been a straight-line to success. Whether he is selling clothing,\n                     operating a cookie business or overcoming an injury to become a record-breaking cyclist,\n                     running for public office, revitalizing Georgia\u2019s film industry, or endowing one of\n                     the country\u2019s most prominent business schools, he has never lost his entrepreneurial\n                     drive to create new opportunities for himself and others.\n                   When young people ask him what they can do to emulate his success, he likes to share\n                     a story from his own past. At the age of 23, Michael was on a flight home to Detroit\n                     seated next to a successful businessman who specialized in mergers and acquisitions.\n                     Toward the end of the flight, Michael asked him if he had any advice that he might\n                     share. \u00a0\n                   \u00a0\u201cHe looked at me and said \u2018it\u2019s all about taking risks. The younger you are, the\n                     easier it is. If you wait too long, life gets complicated and risks become scarier.\n                     Don\u2019t be afraid to take risks, and don\u2019t be afraid to fail.\u2019\n                   \u201cYou have to recognize that failure and success run hand and hand,\u201d Michael adds.\n                     \u201cThere\u2019s more to learn from things that go wrong than from things that go right.\u201d\n                   GI Bill\u00ae is a registered trademark of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n                        More information about education benefits offered by VA is available at the official\n                        U.S. government Web site at \u00a0 https://www.benefits.va.gov/gibill .

At Coles College of Business we have intentionally examined our strengths,\n                     the needs of our students and the goals of our community to determine where we can\n                     make the biggest contributions. The result is four ambitious areas of impact that\n                     will elevate our world-class research, educate the next generation of leaders, connect\n                     us globally and support economic growth in our region and the world. \u00a0 Preparing our students for career contributions in the local economy and beyond is\n                              central to the Coles College of business  mission . At Coles, we spend time connecting with our students and listening to business leaders.\n                              This helps our faculty create curriculum that pushes our students to aspire for more\n                              than just a degree, to aspire to lead and contribute from the moment they graduate.\u00a0 Our students have access to guest lectures, mentorship, consulting opportunities and\n                              professional development programs that increase first-year employment productivity\n                              and employer ROI by as much as 40 percent. Through initiatives like the\u00a0 Hughes Leadership and Career Program , our undergraduate students are prepared to compete in today\u2019s challenging job market.\u00a0\n                              Designed by faculty using feedback from potential employers, students are immersed\n                              in activities created to develop their leadership potential, collaboration skills\n                              and negotiation tactics to name a few. The\u00a0Coles College  Scholars Program Minor  offers a unique opportunity for our top students to learn with a diverse cohort,\n                              take advanced business courses and collaborate on business consulting projects with\n                              external companies. Experience is the key to graduating career ready students, and our  internship program  encourages all Coles students to gain valuable hands-on experience outside of the\n                              classroom. In the past year alone more than 50 percent of our students completed a\n                              successful internship during their academic year, totaling more than 11,000 hours\n                              of experiential learning. Our nationally ranked  graduate programs  give business professionals the deeper knowledge and leadership skills they need\n                              to advance their career. For example, 88 percent of  Executive MBA  graduates cite an increase in their ability to be promoted and 94 percent report\n                              that their Coles degree increased their value within their organization. Businesses are talking and Coles College is listening. We\u2019re committed to engaging\n                              with the business community to create innovative academic programs that meet the needs\n                              of today\u2019s employers. Whether through a customized  executive education program , a  research endeavor \u00a0or an  internship , we\u2019re here to help move you forward. If you have a problem to solve or a partnership\n                              to explore, just reach out. When companies have a strong local pool of applicants to recruit from it strengthens\n                              their workforce and brings stability to the communities they operate in. By incorporating\n                              employer needs into our curriculum we ensure that our students are\u00a0ready to meet market\n                              demands.

Foley  will join Kennesaw State University Bailey School of Music (BSOM) faculty  Helen Kim , violin,  Charae Krueger , cello, and  Eric Jenkins , piano, on the stage on September 16, 8 p.m., at Morgan Concert Hall in the Dr. Bobbie\n                     Bailey and Family Performance Center.\u00a0 \n                      Xavier Foley returns home to take the stage on September 16 at 8 p.m. at Morgan Concert\n                           Hall in the Dr. Bobbie Bailey and Family Performance Center on the KSU Kennesaw campus. \n                      Double bass is not typically a solo instrument, yet bassist Foley dispels that myth.\n                     He says, \u201cMy great teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music, Edgar Meyer, helped me\n                     change that perception.\u201d He mentions Meyer several times, including crediting him\n                     for being his most influential teacher in bass and one of his favorite living composers.\n                     (His favorite historical composer is Bach.)\u00a0 His journey to studying under Meyer\u2019s tutelage began in Marietta, GA, at Hightower\n                     Trail Middle School, where he practiced \u201cwhenever I could, as I was obsessed with\n                     bass.\u201d He also took piano lessons at Kennesaw State University, under David Watkins,\n                     professor emeritus of piano. \u00a0 Foley\u2019s work \u201c Irish Fantasy \u201d was inspired directly from childhood video games FATE and Super Mario. A joint commission\n                     by the Sphinx Organization, Carnegie Hall, and New World Symphony resulted in a double\n                     concerto \u201c For Justice and Peace \u201d for violin, bass, and string orchestra. \u201cMy double concerto \u2018For Justice and Peace\u2019\n                     was created to mark the 400th year of slavery ever since the arrival of the first\n                     slave ship in Jamestown Virginia, and to embody the struggle that African Americans\n                     went through colonial times to modern times,\u201d he explains on his YouTube channel.\n                     The double concerto was played at Carnegie Hall as part of a program designed to promote\n                     social justice. \n                      Xavier Foley has dispelled the myth that double bass is not a solo instrument.  \n                      \n                   Even though his work has debuted at Carnegie Hall, he\u2019s excited to be performing close\n                     to home. \u201cIt\u2019s always good to see someone who grew up in Cobb County, took lessons\n                     at Kennesaw State\u2014those who know me, know me.\u201d Violinist and faculty Helen Kim previously worked with him when he performed a solo\n                     with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. \u201cIt was brilliant and wonderful playing on every\n                     level. He\u2019s so imaginative with his composition and the way he plays, and the audience\n                     loved him.\u201d He\u2019s still humble, though, and says it surprises him by the fact that \u201cI can actually\n                     play the bass and make a living. At least for now!\u201d\u00a0Kim explains that Foley is evolving\n                     with a rapid realization of his talent. \u201cWe are so lucky to have him on our campus.\n                     I find him very inspirational. He\u2019s an artist of our century.\u201d Foley will teach masterclasses for BSOM students during his campus visit, and he hopes\n                     to bring a new,  \n                         Xavier Foley wrote \"The Artist and the Blacksmith\" to teach the importance of music\n                              in society.  \n                         resh set of ideas to them, but adds \u201cI hope to learn from them, too.\u201d He\u2019s also written\n                     a children\u2019s book, \u201cThe Artist and the Blacksmith\u201d about the meaning of music in society.\n                     The summary explains that \u201cwe are often so consumed by the humdrum of our day-to-day\n                     lives, that we put things that give us joy on the backseat\u2026we need to make time for\n                     what excites our soul, and art is one such thing.\u201d What\u2019s in the future for this young double bass performer?

From Sept. 19 through\n                     Sept. 23, patrons may enjoy a wide variety of concerts beginning with chamber music\n                     of Central and South America. Next, choirs tour the landscape of this diverse region,\n                     followed by the Atlanta Jazz Orchestra. Finally, the week culminates with the KSU\n                     Symphony Orchestra, legendary bandoneon player Daniel Binelli, and cellist Jes\u00fas Castro-Balbi,\n                     led by festival artistic director and guest conductor Germ\u00e1n Guti\u00e9rrez.\u00a0 \n                      Festival artistic director Germ\u00e1n Gutierrez will conduct the Symphony Orchestra with\n                           bandoneon player Daniel Binelli, and cellist Jes\u00fas Castro-Balbi.   \n                      \n                   Guti\u00e9rrez explains that a festival is one way to open minds of American students.\n                     \u201cI applaud KSU for bringing this Festival to campus. Music is a global key to open\n                     doors, and this Festival is one way to open doors for collaboration with a different\n                     culture. There is a great benefit to KSU in general.\u201d Bringing diverse cultures to higher education is his specialty, as Guti\u00e9rrez has directed\n                     Texas Christian University\u2019s (TCU) Latin American Music Center and biennial Latin\n                     American Music Festival since 1996. He is also the Director of Orchestras and Professor\n                     of Orchestral Studies at TCU. It\u2019s been his experience that the Latino community really\n                     appreciate the chance to see part of their culture that is sometimes absent.\u00a0 \u201cThe way to be successful is to take care of each other, to provide the opportunity\n                     for every single culture to feel inclusive and not isolated. If people from other\n                     cultures had no way to eat their favorite foods, they would feel isolated. It\u2019s the\n                     same with music, and if we provide those opportunities, we will have a better society,\n                     no question,\u201d he explains.\u00a0 He is thrilled about conducting Binelli, as he\u2019s one of the top bandoneon players\n                     in the world, and the \u201cgreatest artist of the tango. He\u2019s performed all over the world,\n                     and now he will be on stage with the students at KSU.\u201d\u00a0 The goal of the Hispanic Heritage Festival is to celebrate Latino culture from across\n                     many countries. The Bailey School of Music has partnered with The Latin American Association\n                     to help promote the festival in the local community. Dr. Julia Bullard, Interim Director\n                     of the Bailey School of Music, says, \u201cThe music highlighted this week is very diverse\n                     and may be unlike anything our students have ever played. This Festival is a wonderful\n                     celebration of Hispanic culture and I hope that patrons will attend and bring their\n                     family and friends.\u201d Tickets for each concert range from $5 for students to $12-$15 for regular tickets,\n                     and a special Festival pass for all concerts may be purchased for $45.

If you have a critical graduation issue, please see your academic advisor\n                              as soon as possible. Keep trying! Seats may come available due to other students changing schedules and\n                              new seats may be added throughout the registration period prior to Drop/Add. If you are working on a Minor in a business area, submit the Request for Formal Minor\n                              form to the Business Undergraduate Advising Center (BB 431). If we have this form\n                              with your planned Minor courses on file in the Advising Center, it can speed up the\n                              approval of your requests. If you are an INTS major using Business as one of your disciplinary areas, you must\n                              have an approved program proposal on file in the Office for Undergraduate Business\n                              Programs in order to take upper-division business courses. You must also complete\n                              the lower-division business courses in your approved program before requesting permission\n                              for the upper-division courses. Please note: You will not be approved to take 4000-level business courses if you have\n                              not made sufficient progress on your Major courses, even if you have the specific\n                              business course prerequisites. What should I do if I have not officially received a Closed Course override prior\n                                 to the start of the class? Attend the first day of class and make contact with the instructor. If you are given\n                              an override into a closed class, you do not want to have missed any of the class. When should I put in my Override Request? For any of the override sites, we recommend that you put your requests in as soon\n                              as the system opens. How long will it take for my override to be processed? The turnaround time for a decision ranges from a few hours to 5-7 business days depending\n                              on the number of requests coming into the system. Are overrides guaranteed? No. Your file will be reviewed, and an override will be approved only if you have\n                              satisfactory preparation and you are eligible to take the course you are requesting. How will I know if my override was granted? You will receive an email notification to your KSU student email, whether approved\n                              or denied. When I receive an override, does that mean I am enrolled in the class? No. You will not be automatically enrolled. You must still register after the override\n                              is approved. What if I have a course substitution? If you have a course substitution, the KSU registration system cannot \u201cread\u201d the substitutions\n                              in your file. It will not let you register for a course if you have a substitution\n                              for the prerequisite. What if I have multiple override requests? Be sure to submit your requests in priority order so your most important requests\n                              are considered first. Do not submit an excessive number of requests. When can I submit my request? You can submit your request during the times that each particular system is open,\n                              as stated above. When will my request be reviewed? Requests are reviewed on\u00a0business days\u00a0during regular business hours. When does the online system close? The online system closes the day prior to the end of a registration period to allow\n                              time for processing requests. On the last day of registration,\u00a0requests may be submitted\u00a0in\n                              person\u00a0at the Business Undergraduate Advising Center on the 4th floor of the Burruss\n                              Building (BB 431). Due to time constraints, these requests may not be able to be processed\n                              before the registration period ends. Due to extended registration periods, there may be times when the system has to be\n                              down for maintenance.\u00a0 During open registration periods, you may now add yourself to the waitlist of course\n                              sections in which you wish to enroll. You may add yourself to the waitlist of as many\n                              sections of a course as you would like. If a seat becomes available for you, you will\n                              receive a notification to your KSU email. You will then have 18 hours to register. Once you have registered for your desired course, remove your name from waitlists\n                              for other sections. A few notes: You can find the policy here . Certain courses are restricted to 3 attempts. Any course with a posted grade is counted\n                     as an attempt (including W & WF) even if transferred from another institution. The Coles College of Business has updated the Repeat Override policy for all courses\n                     in our college.\u00a0\u00a0KSU's university-wide policy mandates that a student request permission\n                     for a third attempt in any course from the college that houses it. The Coles College\n                     of Business does not want to prevent you from the ability to sign up for a third attempt,\n                     but will require that you complete a Coles Repeat Contract so that we can better support\n                     you and your success! A student will be required to complete a multi-step process before receiving access\n                     to the intended business course(s). These steps are designed to maximize your success\n                     in the course. Beginning Spring Semester 2018, students will be restricted to three attempts in the\n                              following courses: Withdrawals from a course during the Drop-Add period are NOT counted as an attempt.

Your personal inventory page\n                              can also be shared with prospective employers so they can see the history of these\n                              co-curricular experiences. 100% completion of a BUSA badge in the Flight Academy warrants a \u201csatisfactory\u201d grade\n                     which is passing in a 0-credit hour course. These requirements are detailed in the\n                     syllabus on D2L. Searching for the activities needed for your specific badge (e.g.\n                     \"BUSA 2150- Summer 2021\") is most effective through the  Achievements  or  Dashboard  tabs on the Flight Academy. Using the  Activities  tab proves to be confusing for some as it lists activities for all badges on the\n                     platform. Be one of the first 100 students to receive 100 points in the newly launched points-based\n                     gamification (milestone) badges. The point-based badges are fun and engaging badges\n                     based on the National Associate of Colleges and Employers (NACE) competencies set\n                     to provide you with the intangible skills employers are seeking. Take advantage of\n                     these opportunities for all business students to accrue points to be eligible for\n                     competitions, prizes, and incentives. The Milestone badges can be found within the\n                     Flight Academy (Suitable desktop/mobile app). Points can be achieved by simply attending\n                     the series for \"For Success\" workshops and more.

This program will begin with two main\n                     components: a speaker series and a monthly newsletter.

As opportunities arise, please help\n                     us by sharing this information with your students.\n                   What topics, resources, articles, or speakers would you like to see included?  Let us know !\n                   The third year of the Learning Initiatives Program has focused on keeping our faculty\n                              engaged and connected, specifically through discussions of new teaching techniques\n                              and tools, and by highlighting various extended offerings from the Coles College and\n                              KSU. Those sessions will continue throughout the spring.\n                            Additionally, since the demand for prompt information flow has slowed down a bit recently,\n                              we have decided to reinstitute this newsletter. And yes, I am also on the mailing\n                              list \u2013 so it will fill up my inbox as well!\n                            So far this term, we have had two Coles College Connections sessions focusing on student\n                              impact. We have four more sessions coming this term detailed below. Thank you to everyone\n                              who attended or viewed the recordings. This issue also features links to some fascinating resources that could inspire you\n                              in the classroom.\n                            As always, please let me know what other topics you would like to explore and what\n                              you believe would be valuable for the Coles faculty.\n                            Justin Cochran Director, Learning Initiatives Program\n                            \u201cStudent Support Services from the Dean of Students Office\u201d\u00a0\u2013 Ronald Briggs, Nicole\n                              Phillips, and Colin Chadwick \u2013 January 26, 2021\n                            In March, we had a great visit from Jim Nasr, a blockchain expert, who helped guide\n                              both faculty ( video ) and students ( video ) through the hype and the reality of blockchain technology in business and beyond.\u00a0\n                            Due to a work conflict, our speaker for the April session had to reschedule his visit\n                              to campus, hopefully for the fall term. It is one of the challenges with attempting\n                              to bring in experts for this speaker series. I appreciate your patience with this\n                              change.\n                            In the meantime, on with the exciting articles I have stolen from elsewhere! In this edition: Global Skills Index - Coursera  Coursera has compiled\u00a0their\u00a0Global Skills Index and has found the U.S. to be in the\n                                 second tier in skills associated with Business, Technology, and Data Science.\u00a0 The\n                                 executive summary indicates that the South is lagging behind in each of the three\n                                 areas.\u00a0\u00a0 The Big Bang of Motivation: Questions that Evoke Wonder in Our Students Rebecca Zambrano has written a short article about techniques to help students uncover\n                                 their curiosity about topics.\u00a0 It examines the idea of wonder and might be an effective\n                                 tool for introducing topics to students \u2013 what is the mystery we can explore, what\n                                 questions are on the fringe of our knowledge and understanding?  Click here for a related interview with Pablo Boullosa. What Will the World of Work Look Like in 2035  Along the lines of previous articles in this vein, the authors examine what the future\n                                 of work will look like.\u00a0 They, however, have a different slant on numerous angles\n                                 typically examined when considering the future of work.\u00a0 How do their views change\n                                 or reinforce the modifications we should be making in our own classrooms? The Monday, April 15th event has been postponed to Fall Term 2019. As we get into the second semester of the Learning Initiatives work, I wanted to take\n                              a second to thank all of you that have been involved so far. For those of you that\n                              weren't able to attend a speaker event last fall, there\u2019s time to join the club! We\n                              were able to have four prominent speakers so far, and are targeting two more for the\n                              Spring Semester.\n                            As a part of the Learning Initiatives program, I also want to highlight faculty research\n                              in Coles College on Business Education topics. Part of my inspiration is a publication\n                              from the Academy of Management Conference in 2016 that found that KSU/Coles was in\n                              the weighted  TOP 10  of (primarily AACSB) universities publishing in journals dedicated to Business and\n                              Management Education. KSU was top four in raw ranking! Many of you provided information\n                              about your pursuits in the last few weeks  and the tabulation can be found here. If you have more of these types of publications,\n                                 please email them to me. Our first speaker this term is  Jim Nasr . He has been invited to speak on Blockchain technology and how it is changing industries.\n                              While he may discuss a little bit of currency, the emphasis is on blockchain in its\n                              other business applications. See below for his Bio and more details.\n                            In this edition: As a part of the Learning Initiatives Program, we will be inviting guest speakers\n                                 to stimulate thought and discussion.

It is a movement with economic, organizational,\n                              cultural and technology implications. Industry can benefit from blockchain, but we\n                              need to understand where and how, and to separate noise from signal.\n                            This talk will attempt to demystify blockchain and shed light on current reality and\n                              practical opportunities, more so than theoretical potential. The content is based\n                              on lessons learned conceiving and implementing blockchain and large scale real-time\n                              data technologies for the healthcare industry.\n                            Faculty Session: March 11, 2019, 11:30am-1:00pm, BB 114 Student Session: March 11, 2019, 1:20-2:30pm, BB 114 Case Studies from Dialogues on AI and Ethics At this link, you can find six rich case studies that are compelling and multi-faceted\n                                 created by the University Center for Human Values and the Center for Information Technology\n                                 Policy at Princeton. These cases are well developed and should provide for some stimulating\n                                 discussion in many business classroom settings \u2013 not just in technology classes. If\n                                 you decide to try some of these, please share your experience with me. When the Student Assumes the Role of the Teacher: the Flipped Classroom Experience\n                                  This practice takes advantage of the idea \u201cTo learn, read. To know, write. To master,\n                              teach.\u201d Rather than simply \u201cflipping\u201d the classroom, students are tasked with also\n                              teaching course modules to their peers during the face-to-face session. While many\n                              of you have probably tried variations of this, I thought the formal setup described\n                              was beneficial.\n                            Tech Trends 2019 - Deloitte We are often considering how we might keep classes up-to-date with shifts in technology,\n                              how work responsibilities and design may change for our graduates, and how to keep\n                              students engaged in current events. Deloitte has recently released their Tech Trends\n                              for 2019 that may assist you in stimulating conversation in your courses.

Please check back for future Learning Initiatives\n                                 Events. Thank you all for attending our third event in November with Bill Franks. Bill built\n                              two presentations with a strong practical slant, one for faculty  faculty  and another for  students . The faculty talk emphasized key durable traits that will be valuable for faculty\n                              educating students entering the workforce in the face of changing workplaces and technologies.\n                              The student presentation focused on a set of seven tips that will serve graduates\n                              well in that same changing work environment.\n                            Kelly Monahan\u2019s videos from October are now available as well:  faculty session  or  student session .\n                            We also have a special set of events coming December. Dave Schrader, retired from\n                              Teradata, is spending time traveling around to universities talking about teaching\n                              analytics, and analysis in general, to college students using sports as the backdrop.\n                              Dave just so happens to be on a tour to visit MS State, Alabama, and Auburn in early\n                              December. Thankfully, he was able to add us to his route. Of course, it is during\n                              finals which presents some challenges for student sessions, but hopefully not as much\n                              for faculty.\n                            On December 6, we will be having two semi-structured faculty sessions with Dave Schrader:\n                              11:00am-12:00pm and 1:00pm-2:00pm in BB 270. Please let me know if you are interested\n                              in attending one of these sessions. The broader, combined student/faculty lecture\n                              will be in BB 269 from 2:00pm-4:00pm.\n                            In this edition: As a part of the Learning Initiatives Program, we will be inviting guest speakers\n                                 to stimulate thought and discussion. This year\u2019s events will focus on the \u201cFuture\n                                 of Work\u201d. Industry experts will speak on how the workplace is changing for graduates\n                                 which can impact how we prepare our students for work. December Speaker Profile Dave Schrader  \u2013  December 6, 2018, 2:00-4:00pm, BB 269 Dr. Dave Schrader retired in 2014 from Teradata, a high-tech data analytics company.\n                              Since retiring, he has remained active on the Board of Directors for the Teradata\n                              University Network. In that role, he creates materials for faculty and students to\n                              facilitate learning math, stats, and computer science. He specializes in explaining\n                              how to use databases to create insights for business and sports. He also travels frequently\n                              to campuses to speak on business and sports analytics in addition to being a popular\n                              speaker worldwide. In 2017, he gave 59 talks to students, faculty, and university\n                              staff members at 32 schools to more than 2000 attendees. In 2016, he spoke to more\n                              than 2500 people, including 4 schools in Germany.\n                            Education: Dual Bachelor's Degrees, Mathematics and German, Illinois State University Master's\n                              Degree, Computer Science, Northern Illinois University Ph.D., Computer Science, Purdue\n                              University\n                            Presenting: Faculty & Student Combination Event: Entering the Golden Age of Sports Analytics December 6, 2018, 2:00-4:00pm, BB 269.\n                            Bill Franks mentioned a few resources in his talk in November. Here are some links\n                              to get you started:\n                            8 fascinating and fearsome frontiers of science you should know about This article has 4 promising frontiers and 4 concerning areas of research for the\n                                 world. While I am wondering which world we are headed for \u2013 the Matrix, Gattaca, Ex\n                                 Machina, or insert your favorite Sci-Fi movie (Sharknado?), we should be considering\n                                 still how we are preparing the minds coming through our classrooms to consider these\n                                 possibilities and ethically leverage them.  This white paper (contributed to the newsletter by Dan Stotz) is an in-depth look\n                                 at how automation is going to change the workforce, both in jobs lost and jobs gained.\n                                 It further breaks down this topic within the context of 6 major economies: China,\n                                 Germany, India, Japan, Mexico, and the U.S. Finally, it makes recommendations for\n                                 how to prepare for the coming shifts as businesses, individuals, and governments.\n                                 These insights are relevant to our classrooms immediately.  YouTube Will Invest $20 Million in EduTubers  I had originally thought EduTubers did this, but apparently, I was mistaken.

Student Event: Entering the Golden Age of Sports Analytics Dave Schrader ,  Retired Technology Executive   Thursday, December 6, 2018, 2:00-4:00pm, BB 269.\n                            Thank you for attending our second event in October! Kelly is quite deep in the Future\n                              of Work topic for Deloitte, and I believe her measured approach to the area was helpful\n                              for understanding how we might interpret optimism, hyperbole, and upsides/downsides.\n                              She did communicate to me that she was really impressed with the level of engagement\n                              from both our packed-house faculty and student sessions! I really hope we can keep\n                              the momentum for future speakers.\n                            With that in mind, I am soliciting contacts within McKinsey specifically, and other\n                              agencies generally, for the spring speaker series. McKinsey has an organized effort\n                              around the Future of Work that I will cold call upon if needed \u2013 but would love to\n                              be able to tie in someone\u2019s contact, too. Please  let me know  what ideas you have on this, and the broader direction for the series.\n                            Continue reading to learn about our next speaker, Bill Franks, for some follow-up\n                              resources from Kelly\u2019s talk, and for some articles I found interesting in the past\n                              few weeks.\n                            In this edition: As a part of the Learning Initiatives Program, we will be inviting guest speakers\n                              to stimulate thought and discussion.

Try Ethics and Philosophy Our speaker series is devoted to understanding how the workplace is evolving, and\n                              this article highlights some other considerations for individuals operating in the\n                              near future. Will there be enough emphasis on ethics with the powerful technologies\n                              on the horizon in AI, Biotech, etc.\n                            eduScrum in Class This website highlights how to use SCRUM techniques in the classroom. The ability\n                              to execute project work in iterative and rapid cycles has been mentioned frequently\n                              over the last few years in my interactions with companies. This has led a number of\n                              Coles faculty to consider how principles from Agile, Scrum, and Design Thinking might\n                              be incorporated into our classes to better prepare our students for the workplace.\n                              These techniques are no longer found only in software development, but have made their\n                              way into organizations in many ways. This website is a conversation starter.  Please let me know if you are using any of these techniques in your class .\n                            The Future of Skills: Employment in 2030 This report is a pretty thorough look at how job skills will change in the coming\n                              years. They make cases for a number of trends that they expect, which yields places\n                              for us all to ponder the accuracy and wonder how we might better predict the future.\n                              I highly recommend this report for all of us as we consider how our classes need to\n                              change to stay up to date.\n                            Faculty Event: Evolving Academic Programs to Match the Evolving Job Market   Bill Franks ,  Chief Analytics Officer at International Institute of Analytics   Monday, November 5, 2018, 12:30-1:45pm, BB 117.\n                            Student Event: Preparing for Success in the Evolving Business World   Bill Franks ,  Chief Analytics Officer, International Institute of Analytics Monday, November 5, 2018, 2:00-3:15pm, BB 117\n                            Student Event: Entering the Golden Age of Sports Analytics   Dave Schrader ,  Retired Technology Executive   Thursday, December 6, 2018, 2:00-4:00pm, BB 269.\n                            Thank you for attending our first event in September!

By bundling both degrees into Pathways, highly\n                     motivated and committed students will graduate sooner than their peers and with a\n                     head start on their careers. KSU has a variety of Pathways to choose from with more\n                     being added. A Double Owl Pathway allows students to accelerate their progress toward a master's\n                                    degree by taking graduate-level coursework during the final year of their undergraduate\n                                    studies. Students save time and money by earning a master's degree in one year instead\n                                    of two and enter the workforce with a more advanced complement of knowledge and skills. Save Time -  Through this accelerated model, you can take up to 9 credit hours of graduate-level\n                                       courses as an undergraduate student. Those 9 credit hours will simultaneously satisfy\n                                       both your undergraduate and graduate program requirements. Certain Pathways will allow\n                                       you to finish both degrees in as little as 5 years. Save Money  - Double Owl Pathways provide students the best value for their education by giving\n                                       them the chance to satisfy graduate-level courses at the undergraduate tuition rate.

While payback period and percentage salary increase are easy to measure,\n                     an often overlooked (and harder to quantify) benefit of an EMBA is the networking\n                     component. Mention the word \u201cnetworking\u201d and most people think of conferences and cocktail parties;\n                     not higher education. The problem is the traditional education they experienced in\n                     undergrad is far different from an EMBA experience. Since most EMBAs are designed\n                     for working professionals with a minimum of five years of relevant work experience,\n                     the cohort is much more than a group of students; it\u2019s a rich network of individuals\n                     with varying backgrounds and experiences. From aspiring managers to CEOs, your fellow\n                     classmates could become your employees, your employers or your partners in a new venture. As with anything else in life, you get out of an Executive MBA what you put into it.\n                     The networking needs to be intentional. If you don\u2019t take the time to develop relationships\n                     with your class, you\u2019re diminishing the value of your EMBA. If you\u2019re a slacker on\n                     your team or doing just enough to get by, you are not going to earn the respect of\n                     your fellow students and will be missing out on a tremendous networking opportunity. It\u2019s also important to think beyond your class and begin networking with alumni during\n                     the program. Aside from adding to your network, Alumni can be an important support\n                     system to help you through your EMBA journey. They are also not a bad group to get\n                     to know: A good number of EMBA students are promoted while they are in the program\n                     and many others are promoted soon after graduating. It\u2019s a good bet that many of them\n                     will be at high levels in their organization. So, if you\u2019re comparing the costs of an MBA and an EMBA, and the stats aren\u2019t enough\n                     to impress you, consider the hidden value of networking. After all, they say it\u2019s\n                     not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.

The colleges and universities that make up the National Security Agency\u2019s National\n                     Centers of Academic Excellence in Cybersecurity recently awarded Kennesaw State the\n                     2022 First Place Outstanding Outreach Award. All 347 colleges and universities in\n                     the NCAE program were eligible for the award. NCAE is a partnership between the NSA\u2019s National Cryptologic School, several federal\n                     agencies including the FBI and the Department of Defense, and hundreds of institutions\n                     across the country to enhance cybersecurity education through setting curriculum standards\n                     and encouraging the adoption of security best practices. Kennesaw State has been an\n                     NCAE-designated Center of Excellence since 2004. The University received the Outstanding Outreach Award at the NCAE\u2019s regional annual\n                     meeting in Atlanta, where Kennesaw State earned redesignation through 2027, had the\n                      Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity program  validated as an NCAE-Cyber Defense Education program of study. \u201cAs an NCAE, there\u2019s always the expectation that we will not only prepare students\n                     for careers in security, but that we will also contribute to the improvement of cybersecurity\n                     education within industry, the government, and the community at large,\u201d said Michael\n                     Whitman, professor of Information Security and Assurance and executive director of\n                      Kennesaw State\u2019s Institute for Cybersecurity Workforce Development . The ICWD is a multidisciplinary body overseeing Kennesaw State\u2019s online Bachelor of\n                     Science and  Master of Science in Cybersecurity  degree programs. They also organize several outreach initiatives, including hosting\n                     an annual cybersecurity conference with students, faculty and industry partners; running\n                     faculty training workshops; publishing the Journal of Cybersecurity Education Research\n                     and Practice; and running the Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, where\n                     students from across the region network with peers and industry leaders while competing\n                     to defend computer networks from attack. For Whitman, these outreach efforts \u2013 especially those involving businesses \u2013 are\n                     about educating the community on the importance of information security. \u201cIt\u2019s our information that cybersecurity professionals are protecting,\u201d he said. \u201cIf\n                     we can help banks and information warehouses in the region, then it\u2019s much better\n                     for everyone that they be on the leading edge of information security.\u201d The NSA award also recognized community outreach initiatives organized by the Michael\n                     J. Coles College of Business\u2019s  Department of Information Systems and Security  and its related student organization, the Offensive Security Club. One such initiative is the annual high school capture the flag competition. Open to\n                     young people from around the country, students compete virtually to demonstrate their\n                     knowledge of key information security topics ranging from programming and vocabulary\n                     to password cracking and cryptography. \u201cThis event helps bring the idea of security to the general public\u2019s attention,\u201d said\n                     ISA professor Andy Green, the competition\u2019s organizer. \u201cI target high school students\n                     because they are at that point where they are figuring out what they want to do after\n                     they graduate. Many don\u2019t realize until that point that security is something they\n                     can major in at college.\u201d In addition to the high school competition, the ISS Department partners with the ICWD\n                     on the Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, hosts an annual industry-focused\n                     cybersecurity conference called B-Sides Atlanta, and works closely with the Offensive\n                     Security Research Club to prepare for multiple competitions each year. Meanwhile, the Offensive Security Club has made community outreach one of its main\n                     goals. Not only do students in the club make up the staff for events like the SECCDC\n                     and the high school CTF, but the organization routinely invites members of the community\n                     to attend detailed lectures on cybersecurity topics. The club also maintains a public\n                     server on the popular Discord online collaboration platform. \u201cWe use any techniques we can to teach the student body and anyone else willing to\n                     learn about security,\u201d said Carson Reynolds, a criminal justice major and vice president\n                     of the Offensive Security Club. \u201cBecause of the experiential activities we offer,\n                     the club\u2019s a great gateway to introduce people to security.\u201d While the NSA award positions Kennesaw State University as the national leader in\n                     cybersecurity outreach, those involved in earning the award believe there is still\n                     room to grow. \u201cThis award makes it feel like our efforts are really gaining traction,\u201d Reynolds\n                     said. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be recognized, but it\u2019s important to understand that there\u2019s always\n                     more work to be done.\u201d -Patrick Harbin Photo by David Caselli Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

A major area of research in recent times has been the design of smart policies to\n                     counter terrorism. While governments in developed countries have been by and large\n                     successful in thwarting terrorist attacks, it has come at an enormous cost. These\n                     resources could alternatively have been used for purposes, such education or building\n                     infrastructure. Therefore, it is imperative that the growth of expenditure on security\n                     be evaluated before it affects the long-term growth of the economy. This paper focuses\n                     on two important research issues: determination of the socially optimal level of security\n                     and optimal allocation of resources between profiling and screening, given a chosen\n                     level of security.

As businesses and organizations become more globalized, the traditional MBA alone (see our dual MPA/MBA degree option) is often focused on data and finance while lightly touching on management. As large corporations become more complex, if you can navigate the internal politics of large organizations, you will be highly valued \u2013 regardless of the organization is the private sector, government, or other nonprofit. The focus on critical thinking and people management skills makes an MPA the advanced degree of the future. \u00a0 Format : Face-to-Face, Online or Hybrid Number of Credits:  36 Total Hours Entry Terms:  Fall, Spring Time to Complete:  Two-year Program Application Deadlines: The following are requirements beyond the general Graduate Admissions requirements.

Those programs\n                              were the precursors to the current Maresware data analysis and forensic software.\n                              Around 1986, while a federal investigator, he began working in the area of what is\n                              now termed 'computer forensics.' In search for tools more suitable to the specific\n                              needs of computer forensic investigations, he then began developing software more\n                              targeted at computer forensics for personal computers.\u00a0\n                            While serving as a federal agent, Dan assisted in the development of the original\n                              Seized Computer Evidence Recovery Specialist (SCERS) course at the Federal Law Enforcement\n                              Training Center in Glynco, Georgia.

Following\n                           is a short synopsis of some of the options we have available as we look for ways to\n                           collaborate with you.\n                         Come to campus for a lunchtime talk with cybersecurity, general information system,\n                              business skills, or general topic. You would present the same talk two times with\n                              a meal break in between. This could be on a Monday through Thursday of your choice\n                              subject to scheduling availability.

Scholarship donations could start at as\n                              little as $1000. All monies go to students.\n                            Several KSU Departments have student fellowship programs that will offer a select\n                              number of upper-division students an opportunity to develop specialized skills. These\n                              fellowships could take the form of a departmental fellowship or one that includes\n                              direct engagement with your organization. A fellowship donation of $1000 would result\n                              in the fellowship including the name of your organization and would allow your organization\n                              to identify the semester-long, student project in concert with the faculty member.\n                              Fellowships develop improved connections with the most talented students. The full\n                              donation goes to the student working on the project.\n                            The Institute as well as each KSU Department rely on a Board of Advisors for ongoing\n                              dialogs about curriculum and program activities.

Ideally, this project aligns with a course in our curriculum\n                              and someone within your organization works with the faculty member teaching that course.\n                              This could take the form of a member of your organization serving as the live client,\n                              and winning teams get to be invited to your headquarters with some sort of prize being\n                              awarded.

All 347 colleges and universities in the NCAE program were eligible for the honor. NCAE is a partnership between the NSA\u2019s National Cryptologic School, several federal agencies including the FBI and the Department of Defense, and hundreds of institutions across the country to enhance cybersecurity education through setting curriculum standards and encouraging the adoption of security best practices. Kennesaw State has been an NCAE-designated Center of Excellence since 2004.\u00a0 The University received the Outstanding Outreach Award at the NCAE\u2019s regional annual meeting in Atlanta, where Kennesaw State earned redesignation through 2027 and had the Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity program validated as an NCAE-Cyber Defense Education program of study.\u00a0 \u201cAs an NCAE, there\u2019s always the expectation that we will not only prepare students for careers in security, but that we will also contribute to the improvement of cybersecurity education within industry, the government, and the community at large,\u201d said Michael Whitman, professor of  information security and assurance  and executive director of Kennesaw State\u2019s  Institute for Cybersecurity Workforce Development  (ICWD). The ICWD is a multidisciplinary body overseeing Kennesaw State\u2019s online Bachelor of Science and Master of Science in Cybersecurity degree programs. It also organizes several outreach initiatives, including hosting an annual cybersecurity conference with students, faculty and industry partners; running faculty training workshops; publishing the Journal of Cybersecurity Education Research and Practice; and running the Southeast Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, where students from across the region network with peers and industry leaders while competing to defend computer networks from attack. For Whitman, these outreach efforts \u2013 especially those involving businesses \u2013 are about educating the community on the importance of information security.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s our information that cybersecurity professionals are protecting,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we can help banks and information warehouses in the region, then it\u2019s much better for everyone that they be on the leading edge of information security.\u201d The NSA award also recognized community outreach initiatives organized by the Michael J.

As one of the top preparers of teachers\n                     in Georgia, our excellent faculty, staff, students, and alumni continue to contribute\n                     to the strong reputation of KSU\u2019s Bagwell College of Education.\n                   Our college is relatively young, having been established initially as a division in\n                     1978.

Bagwell, longtime educators and active supporters\n                     of Kennesaw State University, made a generous gift to the university, the college\n                     of education was named for them to recognize their respect for teacher education.\n                     Clarice Bagwell was a teacher and esteemed community leader who served as a trustee\n                     of the KSU Foundation. Leland Bagwell was a chemist, teacher, and entrepreneur who\n                     is remembered for his integrity as a teacher and as a respected business leader.\n                   The Bagwell\u2019s son, Tommy, and his wife, Chantal, continue to support KSU through scholarships,\n                     an Endowed Dean\u2019s Chair of Education, and the naming of the Chantal and Tommy Bagwell\n                     Education Building. In addition to their generous support of the Bagwell College,\n                     they funded the Bagwell Center for the Study of Markets and Economic Opportunity and\n                     the Education Economics Center in KSU\u2019s Coles College of Business.\n                   The faculty and staff of the Bagwell College are grateful for the legacy of giving\n                     that the Bagwell family has bestowed upon KSU. The meaningful impact they continue\n                     to have on our students, faculty and staff is beyond measure.\n                   Teacher education at KSU is a campus-wide effort as reflected through the Educator\n                     Preparation Provider (EPP) community that is led by the Dean of Bagwell College. Since\n                     its inception in 1994, our programs have been developed and delivered in a collaborative\n                     manner.

Informed by responsive engagement in collaborative\n                     partnerships, we advance educational excellence through innovative teaching in an\n                     ever-changing global and digital learning environment. Our mission is to prepare educators\n                     to improve student learning within a collaborative teaching and learning community\n                     through innovative teaching, purposeful research, and engaged service. \u00a0The essence\n                     of our vision and mission is captured in the theme Collaborative Development of Expertise\n                     in Teaching, Learning and Leadership, which was adopted in 2002 to express concisely\n                     the fundamental approach to educator preparation at KSU.\n                   The EPP at Kennesaw State University is committed to developing expertise among candidates\n                     in initial and advanced programs as teachers, teacher leaders and school leaders who\n                     possess the capability, intent and expertise to facilitate high levels of learning\n                     in all of their students through effective, research-based practices in classroom\n                     instruction, and to enhance the structures that support all learning. To that end,\n                     the EPP fosters the development of candidates as they progress through stages of growth\n                     from novice to proficient to expert and leader. Within the EPP conceptual framework,\n                     expertise is viewed as a process of continued development, not an end-state. To be\n                     effective, teachers and educational leaders must embrace the notion that teaching\n                     and learning are entwined and that only through the implementation of validated practices\n                     can all students construct meaning and reach high levels of learning. In that way,\n                     candidates are facilitators of the teaching and learning process. Finally, the EPP\n                     recognizes, values and demonstrates collaborative practices across the college and\n                     university and extends collaboration to the community-at-large. Through this collaboration\n                     with professionals in the university, local communities, public and private schools\n                     and school districts, parents and other professional partners, the EPP meets the ultimate\n                     goal of bringing all of Georgia\u2019s students to high levels of learning.\n                   Knowledge Base: \u00a0 Teacher development is generally recognized as a continuum that includes four phases:\n                     pre-service, induction, in-service, renewal (Odell, Huling, and Sweeny, 2000). Just\n                     as Sternberg (1996) believes that the concept of expertise is central to analyzing\n                     the teaching- learning process, the teacher education faculty at KSU believes that\n                     the concept of expertise is central to preparing effective classroom teachers and\n                     teacher leaders. Researchers describe how during the continuum phases teachers progress\n                     from being Novices learning to survive in classrooms toward becoming Experts who have\n                     achieved elegance in their teaching. We, like Sternberg (1998), believe that expertise\n                     is not an end-state but a process of continued development.\n                   Use of Technology Statement: Technology Standards for Educators are required by the Professional Standards Commission.\n                     \u00a0Telecommunication and information technologies will be integrated throughout the\n                     master teacher preparation program, and all candidates must be able to use technology\n                     to improve student learning and meet Georgia Technology Standards for Educators. \u00a0During\n                     the courses, candidates will be provided with opportunities to explore and use instructional\n                     media, especially microcomputers, to assist teaching. \u00a0They will master use of productivity\n                     tools, such as multimedia facilities, local-net and Internet, and feel confident to\n                     design multimedia presentations. In addition, teacher candidates will use technology\n                     to teach students, demonstrating an impact on student learning.\n                   School-Based Activities Statement: As a teacher candidate, you are encouraged to be involved in a variety of school-based\n                     activities directed at the improvement of teaching and learning. Activities may include,\n                     but are not limited to, tutoring students, assisting teachers or other school personnel,\n                     attending school board meetings, and participating in education- related community\n                     events. As you continue your teacher candidate experiences, you are encouraged to\n                     explore every opportunity to learn by doing.\n                   EPP Diversity Statement: A variety of materials and instructional strategies will be employed to meet the needs\n                     of the different learning styles of diverse learners in class. Candidates will gain\n                     knowledge as well as an understanding of differentiated strategies and curricula for\n                     providing effective instruction and assessment within multicultural classrooms. One\n                     element of course work is raising candidate awareness of critical multicultural issues.\n                     A second element is to cause candidates to explore how multiple attributes of multicultural\n                     populations influence decisions in employing specific methods and materials for every\n                     student. Among these attributes are ethnicity, race, socioeconomic status, gender,\n                     giftedness, disability, language, religion, family structure, sexual orientation,\n                     and geographic region. An emphasis on cognitive style differences provides a background\n                     for the consideration of cultural context.\n                   Kennesaw State University provides program accessibility and accommodations for persons\n                     defined as disabled under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 or the Americans\n                     with Disabilities Act of 1990. A number of services are available to support students\n                     with disabilities within their academic program.

To that end, we have launched the\u00a0Call Me MISTER\u00ae\u00a0(Mentors Instructing\n                     Students Toward Effective Role Models) program.\n                   Originally founded at Clemson University in 2000,\u00a0Call Me MISTER\u00ae\u00a0is an educator mentorship\n                     and development program that aims to place more males of color into elementary and\n                     middle schools.\u00a0Call Me MISTER\u00ae\u00a0is a highly acclaimed program that recognizes the\n                     value and the need for a highly qualified and diverse teacher workforce. This dynamic\n                     program has proven to be effective as Clemson reports 98% of the students that have\n                     completed the\u00a0Call Me MISTER\u00ae\u00a0program remain in the field of education.\n                   The mission of the\u00a0Call Me MISTER\u00ae National Initiative is to increase the pool of\n                     available teachers from a broader more diverse background particularly among the State\u2019s\n                     lowest performing elementary schools. Student participants are largely selected from\n                     among under-served, socio-economically disadvantaged and educationally at-risk communities.\n                     Selected student participants known as MISTERs are required to attend a four-year\n                     institution to complete their program of study in teacher education and baccalaureate\n                     degree. In some cases, the program may allow enrollment in a Master of Teaching degree\n                     program leading to initial certification. It is expected that a MISTER who completes\n                     his program of study and becomes certified to teach will assume a teaching position\n                     and teach one year for each year they received financial support from the\u00a0Call Me\n                     MISTER\u00ae\u00a0program. Moreover, in addition to the formal teacher education curriculum,\n                     MISTERs are required to actively participate in the program\u2019s Servant Leadership model\n                     or co-curriculum, which entails individual, group development and community outreach\n                     activities.\n                   I am a dedicated Servant Leader perpetuating a sorely needed concept\u2014 servant leaders\n                     as role models in elementary schools. I am devoted to planting seeds of dignity and\n                     respect in children and inspiring them to cultivate those seeds producing a crop of\n                     unprecedented success. I will teach reading, writing and arithmetic and progress to\n                     self-esteem, imagination and determination.

I also have the pleasure of serving as the\n                     inaugural director of our Call Me MISTER program.\n                   I have over eight years of experience as an educator in several high-needs public\n                     schools in Florida. My journey in the field of education began as a teacher of students\n                     with disabilities in a first grade self-contained classroom. After teaching for a\n                     year in this setting, I took a similar position as a special education teacher in\n                     a Kindergarten to 2nd grade self-contained class. I worked in this setting for a year\n                     until I was persuaded by a principal of a nearby middle school to join his faculty\n                     as special education teacher and coordinator of an intensive reading program. Once\n                     transitioned into these new roles, I remained at the middle school for a year until\n                     that same principal got transferred to an elementary school and once again convinced\n                     me to come along. Only this time I would be transitioning into a Behavior Specialist\n                     position. My time as a Behavior Specialist was critical to my development as a teacher\n                     educator because in addition to supporting teachers and students, I became a trainer\n                     of several district professional development initiatives. In this capacity I provided\n                     professional development in the areas of positive behavior supports systems, nonviolent\n                     crisis intervention strategies, and cultural competency. Working with teachers across\n                     the district deepened my understanding of the importance of teachers being provided\n                     with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions needed to effectively meet the needs\n                     of diverse students. As a result of this experience, my passion as an educator shifted\n                     to an intentional focus on educator preparation.\n                   I earned my Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction with an Emphasis in Special Education\n                     Policy (2013), a M.A. in Special Education (2007), and a Graduate Certificate in Educational\n                     Leadership (2007) from the University of South Florida. My B.S. in Special Education\n                     is from Bethune-Cookman College (2002). My primary scholarly interests are situated\n                     within the context of culturally responsive educator preparation. My research interest\n                     and passion for my work with Call Me MISTER\u00ae\u00a0emerge from a deep desire to improve\n                     the social and educational outcomes of students from historically marginalized backgrounds.\n                     I look forward to partnering with others who similarly share a passion for achieving\n                     equity, inclusion, and social justice for all students.\n                   Tristan L.

These collaborative partnerships are a shared endeavor\n                     meant to focus dually on the improvement of student learning and development and on\n                     the preparation of teachers for this goal. The partners shall work together to determine\n                     not only the values and expectations of program development, implementation, assessment,\n                     and continuous improvement, but also the division of responsibilities among the various\n                     partnership stakeholders. Characteristics of effective partnerships include: mutual\n                     trust and respect; sufficient time to develop and strengthen relationships at all\n                     levels; shared responsibility and accountability among partners, and periodic formative\n                     evaluation of activities among partners. Darling-Hammond and Baratz-Snowden call for\n                     strong relationships between universities and schools to share standards of good teacher\n                     that are consistent across courses and clinical work. This relationship could apply,\n                     as well, to all providers. The 2010 NCATE panel proposed partnerships that are strategic\n                     in meeting partners' needs by defining common work, shared responsibility, authority,\n                     and accountability.\n                   For more information please call (470) 678-6734 or Email us at\u00a0 fieldexp@kennesaw.edu .\n                   Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

The Fast Start\n                     Academy began in 2001 as a community engagement project through Volunteer Kennesaw,\n                     but when a re-organization in VKSU threatened to shutter its doors, the Bagwell College\n                     of Education stepped up to save it.\n                   Focused on reading and literacy, the program is now housed in the Center for Literacy\n                     and Learning in the BCOE.\n                   \u201cSummer 2016 was the first version of the program that was managed by the BCOE,\u201d  said Center for Literacy and Learning Co-Director Megan Adams.  \u201cThe two lead teachers in the Fast Start classroom were teacher candidates and each\n                        was recommended by at least two professors in the department of Elementary and Early\n                        Childhood Education. They were two of the top students in their programs.\u201d In addition to the lead teachers, students had the benefit of six America Reads tutors,\n                     referred to as assistant lead teachers.\n                   \u201cWhat was really amazing was the ownership the lead teachers accepted for the project,\n                        designing the curriculum, training other tutors, organizing the times that reading\n                        tutors came in and how that would work,\u201d  Adams said.  \u201cOriginally, the program was meant to help students at least two grade levels behind\n                        in reading, but once we completed the literacy assessments, we found some of the students\n                        were reading at a middle or high school level. In future summers the program will\n                        only be for rising third and fourth graders performing below grade level.\u201d The program is also aimed at students from low socioeconomic backgrounds. \u201cIt certainly is a program that is reaching students from low socioeconomic backgrounds,\n                        and at the same time, it\u2019s giving our preservice teachers experience working exclusively\n                        with -students from low socioeconomic backgrounds,\u201d  Adams said.  \u201cBecause of where we\u2019re located a large percentage of our preservice teachers do their\n                        field experiences in Cobb and Cherokee counties and often in schools that are non-Title\n                        1 schools. The projection for the next 10 years, however, is they are going to be\n                        working with students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and there are different teaching\n                        theories to help our teachers perform better with marginalized students. We want to\n                        make sure they are getting those experiences.\u201d Previously, between 25 and 30 students participated in the academy, but Adams said\n                     she and co-director Sanjuana Rodriguez hope to grow the program to more than 50 students\n                     each summer attending class for three to four weeks.\n                   \u201cPreviously, students found out about the program through word of mouth and teacher\n                        recommendations, but we hope to shift to a data-driven program that identifies the\n                        kids that really need the most intensive summer help,\u201d  Adams said.\n                   The program has also provided research opportunities for BCOE faculty.  \u201cIt\u2019s this rich resource for folks who are interested in how our field experiences\n                        impact our candidates,\u201d  she said.\n                   Researchers have already published two chapters and are working on an article for\n                     publication about the change in preservice teachers\u2019 sense of efficacy in working\n                     with this student population.\n                   Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

To meet\n                     this need, KSU has established mutually beneficial international partnerships for\n                     the placement of student teachers abroad as well as other international engagement\n                     activities.\n                   Student teaching is the capstone experience of the undergraduate degree.

Each student teacher abroad is evaluated\n                     by a KSU supervisor completing the evaluation instruments required by BCOE/EPP.\n                   In collaboration with the  Education Abroad Office , student teachers are registered for 6 to 12 credit hours in the appropriate area\n                     of certification as study abroad participants and charged a study abroad fee equivalent\n                     to those designated credits. These resources support the exchange requirements for\n                     BCOE/EPP for training and supervision in the international schools.

The GaPSC performs a criminal history\n                     background check prior to issuing a Pre-Service Certificate. Failure to obtain an\n                     issued Pre-Service Certificate will preclude continuation in Teacher Education.\n                   To be eligible for this certificate, candidates MUST \u00a0 An issued Pre-Service Certificate is required to participate in field and/or clinical\n                     experiences associated with courses required in Teacher Education programs.

See Code of Ethics:  https://www.gapsc.com/rules/current/ethics/505-6-.01.pdf .\n                   Thus, when candidates receive clearance to enter the field, they are required by Standard\n                     Nine to self-report any incidences that may occur afterward. KSU Teacher Education\n                     programs are also required by the GaPSC (Rule 505-3-.1) to report \"any violations\n                     of the Georgia Code of Ethics for Educators by enrolled candidates\" (p. 17). Candidates\n                     must also self-report to the Director of CEPP at KSU. The Pre-Service Certificate\n                     may be revoked if a candidate violates the Georgia Code of Ethics, and the candidate\n                     may be removed from Teacher Education.\n                   NOTE: \u00a0A Pre-Service Certificate is verified by ESS through an advisor review for the Yearlong\n                        Clinical Experience (YCE) application and the signature of the Director of Education\n                        Student Services (ESS) is required at this time.

She holds an early childhood education bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree in  leadership , as well as a specialist and doctorate in  instructional technology  \u2013 all from Kennesaw State. The skills she learned in her programs at Kennesaw State are more important now than they\u2019ve ever been, and they prepared her for the acceleration of technology use in the classroom, Beasley said. \u201cMy degrees from KSU really put me in a spot to be a good candidate for this position,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything in education continually changes, so we must adapt. The increased use of technology in the classroom is not going away, and we are helping teachers figure out ways to make that work in their setting, whether they\u2019re in a face-to-face classroom or virtual.\u201d Beasley said families choose virtual school for a variety of reasons, from a child\u2019s severe illness to social anxiety or even the convenience. The coronavirus pandemic opened the door to virtual programs when it forced schools to shift temporarily to an all-online format in March 2020, and Cobb Schools has recognized parents will continue to seek the option, she said. No two days are the same, but this year - the program\u2019s first - was spent organizing schedules and curriculum to ensure online students received a comparable education to students in face-to-face settings, Beasley said. She traveled frequently to the 39 locations where Cobb teachers were instructing virtual students, helped to troubleshoot issues that might arise teaching elementary students from a screen and planned to address problems that hadn\u2019t yet come up, or that could be addressed in teacher training. The new virtual program enrolled more than 700 students in the 2021-22 school year,\n                     and there is still a need for the virtual option in the upcoming school year. In the\n                     fall, online program teachers will also be consolidated to three buildings. \u201cAshley is a wonderful example of the caliber of Bagwell College alumni. Her expertise in the instructional technology discipline was enhanced by her experiences within Kennesaw State, and our programs were enhanced by her presence as well,\u201d said Adrian Epps, dean of the Bagwell College. \u201cWe celebrate her appointment to lead within the organizational structures of Cobb County School District, a very important partner for the Bagwell College and Kennesaw State University.\u201d \n                      \n                   Traci Redish, Bagwell\u2019s interim associate dean for strategic partnerships and priorities, said Beasley will be an important leader in the Cobb County School District, as the pandemic has highlighted the ongoing need for instructional technology knowledge and skills for all educators. \u201cThe ability to deliver instruction in all modalities \u2013 face-to-face, blended and online \u2013 has become, and will continue to be, mission critical for K-12 schools moving forward,\u201d Redish said. \u201cDr. Beasley\u2019s expertise in Instructional Technology will be vitally important as she leads her team to accelerate digital learning in Cobb.\u201d \u2013 By Thomas Hartwell Photos by Matt Yung 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Making Their Mark: Newest KSU alumni are ready for the world Spring 2022 Commencement Kennesaw State Awards Ceremony honors outstanding faculty A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

But he says even a few years ago, he never would have\n                     expected to be teaching among schools of fish.\n                      \n                   For 11 years, Dawson taught in Cobb County and Marietta City schools, most recently as a middle school teacher at Marietta Middle School. During that time, he earned both a master\u2019s in instructional technology and a specialist degree in education leadership from KSU\u2019s  Bagwell College of Education . Now, he oversees all education activities at the aquarium, including programming, developing curriculum, securing grants, running professional development for educators and establishing partnerships with community organizations, as well as with other aquariums and zoos.\u00a0 Under his leadership, Georgia Aquarium has become the world\u2019s only STEM-certified aquarium and has added classroom space packed with interactive technology, such as small underwater drones, microscopes and interactive boards. Dawson said the instructional technology education he received at KSU has helped guide\n                     him in his role at the aquarium. \u201cI was able to use everything that I learned through my master\u2019s program and carried it over with some of the programs that I\u2019ve implemented here \u2013 everything from virtual programming to the interactive boards that we have here at the aquarium,\u201d he said. An Alabama native, Dawson grew up in an educator\u2019s household, watching his father work as a teacher and eventually retire as a principal. He said when he began pursuing an education career, he didn\u2019t see the possibilities for what he refers to as informal education. Growing up in a low-income area, Dawson said most people idealized following money over their true passions. But, he said, he decided partway through college that he would take a leap of faith and follow his love for education. Dawson graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in health education from Alabama State University in 2008, an accomplishment he said played a \u201cmajor role\u201d in his future. It was only by happenstance years later, he added, that he was introduced to the director\n                     of Georgia Aquarium while teaching in Marietta and learned not all educators are in\n                     the classroom. \u201cI never visited an aquarium growing up and didn\u2019t know the world of informal education. I didn\u2019t know there were so many opportunities for those who want to educate in different ways,\u201d Dawson said.\u00a0 Shortly after that chance meeting, Dawson was offered a job as a curriculum specialist\n                     at Georgia Aquarium and began work at the downtown Atlanta attraction in 2019. \n                      \n                   Dawson said he loves to see the eyes of children who visit Georgia Aquarium light\n                     up as they watch Beluga whales swim by, or touch a stingray in the interactive tanks,\n                     because he said he can see their excitement to learn. Adrian Epps, dean of the Bagwell College, said he\u2019s watched with pride as Dawson has excelled and moved Georgia Aquarium\u2019s educational goals forward. \u201cIn our partnership efforts with Georgia Aquarium for the past several years, I have observed Bailey's leadership influence in broader educational communities,\u201d Epps said. \u201cHe has increasingly earned the respect of others and been given the opportunity to lead more responsibilities in the aquarium's educational operations.\u201d Brian Davis, president and CEO of Georgia Aquarium, said Dawson continues to impress\n                     and is recognized nationally for his innovation, including serving on the board of\n                     the National Marine Educators Association. \u201cHe is committed to building partnerships that engage students and provide innovative learning opportunities, including remotely operated vehicle workshops for girls and integrating aquaculture systems in classrooms,\u201d Davis said. \u201cHis commitment to community, education and conservation is refreshing and a testament to the positive role educators play in shaping the future for us all.\u201d \u2013 By Thomas Hartwell Photos by Jason Getz 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Kennesaw State alum leads new elementary virtual programs in Cobb Schools  Kennesaw State Academy for Inclusive Learning grad built skills for rewarding career Kennesaw State economic impact increases to more than $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2021 A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

After WWII, the need for technicians\n                     grew and in response the then president of Georgia Tech sought to establish a technical\n                     institute program in Georgia. In March 1948, our roots began as The Technical Institute.\n                     Their first registration began with 116 students (all but 10 were WWII veterans) and\n                     a staff of 12. After just one year, The Technical Institute was renamed to Southern\n                     Technical Institute and was recognized as a college-level school with the US Department\n                     of Education.\n                   By 1961, the college had outgrown its footprint in Chamblee, GA and moved to its now\n                     current location of Marietta, GA. Southern Technical Institute became accredited as\n                     a four-year college in 1970 and was one of the first colleges in the nation to offer\n                     a BS in Engineering Technology. By the summer of 1980, The Southern Technical Institute\n                     achieved independence within the USG by ending ties with Georgia Tech.\n                   1996 the school once again renamed itself to Southern Polytechnic State University\n                     and on November 1, 2013 the Georgia Board of Regents made plans to consolidate SPSU\n                     into Kennesaw State University, leveraging both campuses and offerings to better reach\n                     and educate the next generation. And on July 1, 2015 the Southern Polytechnic College\n                     of Engineering and Engineering Technology was established as a college under KSU in\n                     memorial of the former SPSU.\n                   Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

They also had to design and implement a pneumatic system for an additional application. This project deepened the team\u2019s fluid power knowledge, as well as their interest in the fluid power industry. Students completed the challenge to coincide with their two-semester senior design capstone courses, and industry professionals served as mentors and judges. \u201cWe are so proud of our students for showcasing their engineering prowess against a highly competitive field of students,\u201d said mechanical engineering professor Richard Ruhala, who co-advised the students along with mechanical engineering associate professor and co-advisor, Laura Ruhala. \u201cThough presenting virtually added another layer to the competition, our students adapted and rose to the challenge.\u00a0 The funding from the NFPA allowed their capstone course to be taken to the next level of design, build, test, redesign, and compete.\u201d \n                      Teams competed for cash prizes in three separate races, including sprint, efficiency and endurance. Aside from their second place ranking overall, KSU also won first place in the endurance challenge of the competition. The team\u2019s success earned it a cumulative $3,000 prize from the NFPA that will be distributed equally among the student members. This year marks only the second time that Kennesaw State had participated in the event,\n                     where it outperformed other universities in the challenge hosted by Danfoss Power\n                     Solutions, including Iowa State University, Milwaukee School of Engineering, and the\n                     University of Louisiana at Lafayette, among others. \u2013 Josh Milton Submitted photos 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Kennesaw State awarded NIH grant to improve heart surgeries through use of robots Four Kennesaw State students awarded scholarships from U.S. Department of Energy Kennesaw State professor awarded NSF grant to explore brain-inspired computer vision A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

She said the following about the program, \u201cHaving a husband that is a Civil\n                     Engineer, and an alum of Southern Polytechnic, I have a personal knowledge of what\n                     engineers do to help communities \u201cBuild a Better World.\u201d I also had heard and read\n                     about the shortages of qualified engineers, and asked Dr. Ho to talk about the exciting\n                     career program opportunities available at Kennesaw State University.\u201d\n                   Dr. Ho covered the basics of control systems, breaking the subject down in simple\n                     terms - even the youngest attendee could understand. He presented real world examples:\n                     robots, drones, windmills, solar thermal plant, and more. Throughout the presentation,\n                     Dr. Ho talked about the importance of engineering in our world today. The Q&A from\n                     attendees revealed several middle schoolers and a high school student interested in\n                     robotics and computer engineering. The library hopes to partner with Kennesaw State\n                     University in the future on another great program.\n                   Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

However, her college dreams were nearly put on hold as she looked for ways to offset the cost of attending. Then, she received an email from Kennesaw State University\u2019s  Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering and Engineering Technology  (SPCEET). \u201cI wrote so many essays and applied for so many scholarships until finally I saw an email promoting a new program in the engineering college,\u201d said Ahmed, who applied and was subsequently accepted into the  Women in Engineering: Graduation and Retention/Recruitment Opportunities for Women\n                        (WE-GROW)  program. \u201cThere was such a sense of relief for me. It took care of all of my financial needs and allowed me to focus on my studies.\u201d Today, Ahmed is one of nine students this year who are receiving up to $8,800 in scholarship\n                     money annually as part of WE-GROW. The effort, launched by SPCEET in October 2019\n                     after receiving a $997,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, aims to support\n                     first- and third-year engineering students by providing academic and co-curricular\n                     activities focused improving retention and encouraging the pursuit of rewarding and\n                     successful engineering careers. While the initiative focuses to improve gender diversity in Kennesaw State\u2019s engineering programs, it is open to all academically talented students with demonstrated financial need. The programmatic support offered by the initiative will come in the form of guidance and focused efforts by SPCEET faculty, advisors and staff, and industry partners to cultivate a broader sense of community among the students. \u201cWhile we concentrate on introducing more women to engineering, we recognize that the male participants gain a better appreciation of the need for more women in the field,\u201d said Lori Lowder, assistant dean for accreditation and assessment. \u201cJust like any other initiative, it\u2019s going to require efforts from all parts to see improvements.\u201d In addition to the wraparound support services, students are afforded opportunities\n                     to participate in undergraduate research and STEM outreach efforts at local schools,\n                     and meet with women who are already in the field. \u201cI was particularly struck by the number of women engineers I\u2019ve already met through the industry outreach events,\u201d said Ahmed, who studies  mechanical engineering . \u201cIt\u2019s not often that you see women hold high positions for STEM jobs, and it\u2019s always been a goal of mine to be that same kind of role model for other girls hoping to study engineering.\u201d Like Ahmed,  computer engineering  student Kevin Toyle said the face-to-face time with industry professionals and faculty\n                     mentors have been some of the most impactful aspects of the WE-GROW initiative. Recent\n                     industry meet-and-greets have involved professionals from a variety of industries,\n                     including those representing Siemens and NASA. Toyle also likes giving back to the younger generation, taking advantage of an opportunity\n                     to serve as a guest judge in an elementary school science fair as part of WE-GROW. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to connect with people, especially kids who are starting to explore STEM fields,\u201d he said. \u201cI received my inspiration at a young age, and I enjoy seeing how the next generation finds theirs. As WE-GROW continues to evolve, Lowder said the engineering college expects to extend\n                     services to the larger student body to build upon student success. \u201cWe are looking to make this a part of our larger student recruitment strategy,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we also want to make sure that we are doing our best to support them once they\u2019re here and make sure they graduate en route to fruitful careers.\u201d \u2013 Travis Highfield Photos by Judith Pishnery 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Kennesaw State awarded NIH grant to improve heart surgeries through use of robots Four Kennesaw State students awarded scholarships from U.S. Department of Energy Kennesaw State professor awarded NSF grant to explore brain-inspired computer vision A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

An  industrial engineering technology  student and a member of the Kennesaw State  women\u2019s lacrosse team , she happens to have first-hand experience with both. So does her twin sister, Marissa\n                     Gore, her lacrosse teammate and  electrical engineering  student in the  Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering and Engineering Technology  (SPCEET). \u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of free time due to our commitments to lacrosse and engineering, but we know that those sacrifices are going to pay off in the long run,\u201d Siena said. So far, their sacrifices have paid dividends. Between waking up before sunrise for early morning workouts and shuttling down to KSU\u2019s Marietta Campus every day for class, the sisters have seen a considerable amount of success both on and off the field. Siena, who was named 2019 ASUN Player of the Year, has also received ASUN All-Academic Team honors while earning a 4.0 GPA. Marissa was awarded the  SPCEET Outstanding Undergraduate Student Award  while also posting a 4.0 GPA, and was previously recognized as a member of the ASUN\n                     All-Conference and All-Academic teams. Both Siena and Marissa credit their uncle, an aerospace engineer, for inspiring them\n                     to pursue engineering degrees. He would often show his work to the twins and speak\n                     about the breadth of the field overall. The sisters ultimately committed to Kennesaw\n                     State during their sophomore year at Chattahoochee High School after learning about\n                     the addition of engineering programs through the 2015 consolidation of KSU and Southern\n                     Polytechnic State University. \u201cWe pretty much knew the minute we stepped on campus that this was exactly where we wanted to be,\u201d Siena said. Marissa, who settled on electrical engineering on the advice of her uncle, said that her lacrosse schedule often makes it difficult to participate in extracurriculars on the Marietta Campus, but she was able to secure an internship with Lockheed Martin. There, she explored her interest in avionics \u2013 the electrical systems that control aircraft \u2013 and gained experience working on Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules airplane. Following the internship, she was offered a full-time position with the aerospace\n                     giant, which she has accepted. Siena, who interned in Northrop Grumman\u2019s space systems division, said she chose industrial engineering technology since it combined her interests in logistics, manufacturing and project management. At Northrop Grumman, she gained experience working on the harness components of spacecrafts, eventually coming face to face with a Cygnus cargo spacecraft prior to its launch. \u201cIt was an unbelievable experience getting to work in a place like that, and it really cemented the fact that I was in the right field,\u201d she said. \u201cI could really envision myself making a career in the aerospace industry.\u201d While Marissa preps to enter the industry upon graduation, Siena will be taking advantage\n                     of an extra year of eligibility granted to student-athletes as a result of the COVID-19\n                     pandemic to start a graduate degree in  systems engineering . \u201cOverall, our KSU experience has been nothing short of amazing,\u201d Siena said. \u201cI get to attend a great school, receive a great degree and play my favorite sport with my best friend. It\u2019s a dream come true for us, and we\u2019re so grateful that KSU gave us this opportunity.\u201d \u2013 Travis Highfield Photos by Jason Getz 3D Printing Ecosystem transforms education at Kennesaw State University Weeks of Welcome Kennesaw State welcomes more than 43,000 students for the first day of Fall Semester 2022 Kennesaw State celebrates opening of new residence hall for first-year students A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

Notification of Admissions Decision s. Contemporaneously with notifications of admissions decisions, applicants will be\n                     informed of their ability to appeal those decisions and directed to the University\u2019s\n                     web resources detailing the appeals process. \u00a0 \u00a02. T he Appeal.\u00a0 a. Basis for appeal. \u00a0 Appeals of admissions decisions may follow different processes based on the grounds\n                     of the appeal. i.\u00a0 Discrimination. \u00a0 If the applicant believes her or his admissions decision is impermissibly based upon\n                     the applicant\u2019s real or perceived gender identity, sexual orientation, veteran status,\n                     spiritual beliefs, physical abilities, racial and ethnic background, and economic\n                     status, the applicant may directly contact the University\u2019s Office of Diversity &\n                     Inclusion at 470-578-2614. ii.\u00a0 Other basis . If the applicant wishes to appeal his or her admissions decision based on other\n                     factors, the applicant needs to submit a written appeal to the Dean of The Graduate\n                     College. b. \u00a0 Written Appeal. \u00a0 Within\u00a0thirty (30) days of the mailing date of the admissions decision, the applicant\n                     may file an appeal. The appeal should, \u00a0 at a minimum , contain the following: i. An explanation of the admissions decision; ii. An explanation of why the applicant believes the decision was incorrect; iii.Identification of any evidence the applicant believes supports her or his position.\n                     The applicant may be asked to provide this information to permit The Graduate College\n                     to process his or her appeal; iv. Any other information the applicant believes is relevant to her or his appeal. Effective appeals will typically involve information the applicant may not have provided\n                     in his or her original application, but which might have influenced the University\u2019s\n                     decision regarding her or his application.\u00a0 For example, following notification of an unsuccessful application, an applicant for\n                     the Master of Science in Criminal Justice might speak to a professor regarding his\n                     or her application.\u00a0 During that conversation, the applicant notes her or his five\n                     (5) years of successful service as a law enforcement officer.\u00a0 The professor notes\n                     this was not included in the original application and states the program faculty might\n                     believe it relevant to their consideration of the application.\u00a0 The professor then\n                     suggests the applicant file an appeal, providing specific evidence of his or her successful\n                     law enforcement record and an explanation of why the applicant believes it contributes\n                     to his or her strength as a graduate student in that discipline. Please note The Graduate College is unlikely to be influenced by arguments in which\n                     the applicant is challenging the judgment of a program\u2019s faculty regarding particular\n                     aspects of the program\u2019s application.\u00a0 This is particularly true regarding the faculty\u2019s\n                     assessment of an applicant\u2019s undergraduate grade point average or his or her scores\n                     on an admissions examination required by the program (e.g., GRE, MAT) or the weight\n                     to give such items in the faculty\u2019s evaluation of the applicant. c. Submission of Appeal. \u00a0 The appeal may be submitted electronically, as an attachment, or in writing to The\n                     Graduate College. It should be submitted to: Assistant Dean for Graduate Students 3391 Town Point Dr. NW Room 2809, MD 9106 Kennesaw, GA 30144 gradcollegeforms@kennesaw.edu The Graduate College will acknowledge receipt of the appeal electronically or through\n                     US Mail. 3. Review Process. \u00a0 Upon receipt of the appeal, The Graduate College will identify an appropriate process\n                     for reviewing the appeal. This process may vary based upon the grounds of the appeal(such\n                     as a need to solicit input from the graduate program faculty). After identifying and\n                     receiving information and evidence relevant to the appeal, The Graduate College will\n                     empanel a group of at least three (3) members of the University\u2019s Graduate Faculty\n                     to review the appeal. The Graduate Faculty members will make a recommendation regarding\n                     the appeal to the Dean of The Graduate College. 4.Decision. \u00a0 In the absence of exceptional circumstances, within fourteen (14) of the receipt of\n                     the appeal, the Dean of The Graduate College will issue a decision regarding the appeal.\n                     It will be communicated to the applicant through U.S. or electronic mail. Appeal of The Graduate College\u2019s Decision. Within fourteen (14) days of the mailing\n                     date of the Dean\u2019s decision, the applicant may appeal The Graduate College\u2019s determination\n                     by sending a written appeal to the Provost of Kennesaw State University.

Patricia also researched microgravity\u2019s effects on blood\n                     flow in the carotid artery.\u00a0 Martin Garcia spent most of his childhood living in a concrete farmhouse in an impoverished\n                     area of Guanajuato, Mexico, passing the time by crafting toys out of leftover tools\n                     and car parts at a local mechanic shop. It was during these visits to the shop that he established his curiosity with the\n                     function and design of machinery, ultimately inspiring him to chase his calling as\n                     a future engineer. This month, Garcia will graduate from Kennesaw State University\n                     with a degree in mechanical engineering after an illustrious undergraduate career\n                     in the Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering and Engineering Technology.  Read More . Jackson Hill, a mechanical engineering student minoring in nuclear engineering, was\n                     featured in the  Student Spotlight  section of the  Department of Career Planning & Development . He was interviewed on how the department helped, his co-op experience at a nuclear\n                     plant, and the advice he has for other students. How has Career Planning & Development helped? Career Planning and Development enabled me to be connected in the career fair where\n                     I was able to interview with multiple companies. Originally, I didn't think about\n                     applying for a Southern Company Co-Op until I spoke to them at the career fair. I\n                     realized that their Co-Op program was what I wanted to experience. Through Career\n                     Planning and Development, I was able to be involved in Southern Company networking\n                     events and on campus interviews, leading me to my current job. How was your co-op experience? Throughout the Spring 2020 semester I worked my first rotation for Southern Nuclear\n                     at Plant Vogtle in Waynesboro Georgia. I was involved in the 1R22 refueling outage\n                     (replacing Uranium fuel in the Unit 1 reactor), creating a design change package,\n                     and engineering of components such as pumps, motors, and valves throughout the plant.\n                     Alongside this work, I toured Units 3&4, the first new nuclear reactors under construction\n                     in 30+ years in the US. What advice do you have for other students? Firstly, I would advise students to leave their comfort zone and network with employers,\n                     professors, and other organizations. By joining NESEL at KSU, I was able to further\n                     deepen my knowledge of both Mechanical Engineering and Nuclear Engineering. Secondly,\n                     be involved with campus groups such as Career Planning and Development. Their resources\n                     gave me the impetus and assistance to creating a well-rounded resume and elevator\n                     pitch which I was able to use when applying for Co-Ops. Electrical Engineering graduate Kara Dees is so excited that her research on Wi-Fi\n                     connectivity in rural Georiga has led to meetings with Lieutenant Governor Geoff Duncan,\n                     Executive Director of the Rural Broadband Program Deanna Perry, and state Senator\n                     Steve Gooch, who sponsored a bill to allow the state to create its own broad band\n                     maps. All four are interested in expanding broadband deployment in Georgia, especially rural\n                     areas because of the way the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) maps broadband\n                     availability from census data. Dees explained that if one residence or business has\n                     broadband access, then the whole census block is considered broadband accessible.\u00a0 As Dees was pursuing her statistics minor, she became passionate about solving this\n                     problem when she heard that a classmate had to walk to the end of his driveway to\n                     log in to Desire2Learn, KSU\u2019s learning platform, because of an inadequate internet\n                     connection.

Traditional methods involve\n                     a wood formwork, a permanent or temporary mold into which concrete is poured, which\n                     results in the usual rigid concrete structures found in most buildings and homes. \u201cInstead of wood, we use material such as fabric in a concrete formwork, which creates\n                     some really cool shapes and curves that you would not normally see in concrete,\u201d she\n                     explained. \u201cThe texture is also different, and the fabric formwork creates non-rigid\n                     structures because of its high flexibility.\u201d \u201cYou learn a lot through research. for example, from one day of research on this project,\n                     I learned much more about concrete than I ever had before,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I am really\n                     excited to learn about the different aspects of structural engineering and getting\n                     to see the architecture because, as a civil engineer, I do not get to see much architecture.\u201d\n                      Read more \u00a0 Alex Resnick is a recent mechanical engineering graduate.

Mechatronics student completed VR direct study October 2019 Tyler Gragg is a current engineering student working towards his BS in mechatronics\n                     engineering at KSU. Gragg completed a directed study this semester, where he controlled\n                     a RC Car from Virtual Reality. The whole project centered around the idea that Gragg\n                     would be able to strap on a VR headset and drive a real-life car from Virtual Reality.\n                     Gragg was able to wire the robot to have lights, a horn, and even speed control, from\n                     VR going to the car with live video being fed back from the car - in real time - to\n                     the user in VR.\u00a0 In addition to creating the project, Gragg also wrote an academic paper and submitted\n                     it to the Early Career Technical Conference at the University of Alabama Birmingham.\n                     It was accepted and Gragg join with 25 others presenting papers from their respective\n                     fields.\u00a0 To learn more, check out Gragg\u2019s  website  and  Instructables . Mechanical Engineering Student Presented at Academic Conferences June 2019 Tate is a mechanical engineering junior at Southern Polytechnic College of Engineering\n                     and Engineering Technology (SPCEET), minoring in German. He had the opportunity to\n                     present at undergraduate academic conferences at both the state and national levels\n                     this past academic year. In fall 2018, Tate and Alisa Machiwalla, also a mechanical engineering student at\n                     KSU, attended the Georgia Undergraduate Research Collective (GURC) conference hosted\n                     by the University of North Georgia. In spring 2019, he was one of about 400 KSU undergraduates\n                     to participate in the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR), the largest\n                     conference of its kind in the country, which was hosted by KSU. Tate has also served\n                     as vice president for the KSU chapter of the Association of Energy Engineers, and\n                     most recently, was selected as president of the KSU chapter. At GURC, Tate and Alisa modeled a way to predict how temperature behaves given the\n                     geometry or shape of the core of a specific nuclear reactor, called the Molten Salt\n                     Reactor (MSR). This is a nuclear fission reactor that uses a liquid fuel salt instead\n                     of solid fuel as the fuel and coolant. Nuclear reactors are usually used at nuclear\n                     power plants, for example, to generate electricity. In their research, they manipulated\n                     the shape of the reactor core to minimize heat build-up. Since they know how temperature\n                     and velocity are related, the key was finding the optimal reactor design, which reduces\n                     drastic variations in both. For NCUR, Tate mapped how geographical variations affect energy costs throughout the\n                     United States by using a Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) model. The objective was\n                     to breakdown nationwide costs and investigate assumptions that are made on a state\n                     level; in this case, Georgia was the chosen sample to explore how challenges in solar\n                     technology affect the cost of clean carbon energy. Tate first got involved in undergraduate research by reaching out to the Nuclear Energy,\n                     Science, and Engineering Laboratory (NESEL) - a multi-disciplinary research organization\n                     in SPCEET. He did this because, initially, he started economic research on energy\n                     utility markets with the Bagwell Center for the Study of Markets and Economic Opportunity\n                     in Coles College of Business. The NESEL group Tate works with now relates to the economic\n                     research he is conducting. This allows him the ability to explore an interesting intersection\n                     between engineering and finance. Undergraduate research is important to Tate because it contributes to the world's\n                     ever growing knowledge pool and impacts the world. More importantly, for the researcher,\n                     it allows the ability to apply current knowledge and transfer the skills learned in\n                     the classroom into tangible results. Tate\u2019s heart is imbued with gratitude towards\n                     KSU, and as a proud student, he looks forward to furthering his collective impact\n                     in the academic community. Civil engineering graduate student conducted a research project May 2019 Civil engineering graduate student Pablo Giraldo-Clavijo conducted a research project\n                     that focused on investigating the effectiveness of styrofoam (a new type of lightweight\n                     materials) traffic noise walls as compared to conventional metal or concrete noise\n                     materials. According to U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, noise\n                     barriers do not completely block all noise; they only reduce overall levels of sound.\n                     Effective noise barriers typically reduce noise levels by 5 to 10 decibels (dB), cutting\n                     the loudness of traffic by as much as one half. Giraldo-Clavijo\u2019s final thesis research\n                     project could lead to a better understanding of how to select the best noise reduction\n                     material.

Mechanical engineering student\u00a0making changes in the industry March 2019 Cadmiel Velazquez-rivera is a current mechanical engineering student at Kennesaw State\n                     University. Cadmiel first started with a small internship at M+A Matting company.\n                     He was a manufacturing engineering intern. While there he saved the company $30,000\n                     in labor. He studied the manufacturing/production of products being manufactured.\n                     Cadmiel utilized lean manufacturing and created work instructions for continuous improvement\n                     that could be made around the plant. He gained knowledge about quality control and\n                     product testing. Cadmiel assisted management by conducting time studies based on optimizing\n                     operations to maximize both speed and efficiency of mats being produced. He designed\n                     factory set up drawings to maximize efficiency of floor workers. Cadmiel worked with automatic trim tables to boost daily production. He broke each\n                     individual role in the trimming process to its basic components to better understand\n                     how the process functions. Cadmiel timetabled the packing process to determine the\n                     most efficient way to pack products. He implemented specific work procedures on what\n                     is expected from each role. Cadmiel created standard operating procedures based on task assigned by the plant.\n                     He incorporated the use of pictures and step by step details in a how to guide. He\n                     translated documents to Spanish and communicated them to the non-English speaking\n                     employees. Later Cadmiel applied to work as Shaw Industries as a co-op and got the position.\n                     There he has learn how to weld, drive lift trucks, and work on his own machine designs.\n                     Currently he is working on a project that would save the company thousands of dollars\n                     a month. It involves fixing the issues of carpets being torn apart by shelves. Cadmiel\n                     is also helping with a clutch installations and safety measures for a work area. Electrical Engineering Senior Receives Grant November 2018 2018 NSF Travel Grant Recipient, Danica Roberts, is an Electrical Engineering Senior\n                     at Kennesaw State University - pursing minors in computer science and mathematics.\n                     In addition to her studies, she has been active in her campus community, serving in\n                     key leadership roles in organizations like Society of Women Engineers, Student Government\n                     Association, and Department of Housing and Residence Life. Danica\u2019s research interests currently lie heavily in connected and autonomous vehicular\n                     systems. Danica received a travel grant from the National Science Foundation to attend\n                     the 2018 IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference in Taipei, Taiwan from December 5 to\n                     7, 2018. This conference will provide her the opportunity to conduct investigative\n                     research on vehicular networks, as we all connect with some of the most influential\n                     researchers on vehicular networks. Read more  of her story here Mechatronics engineering student making glass-breaking soundwaves October 2018 Tyler Gragg is a mechatronics engineering student who set out to make a handheld device\n                     to break glass, using sounds! He programmed all of it himself to automatically determine\n                     the resonant frequency and produce 130db of sound. Gragg designed and manufactured\n                     a 3D printed enclosure for all the electronics, which he designed and wired himself\n                     as well. Gragg also made all of the code, files, and diagrams. An overview of his project can be seen on  Wine Glass Shattering Audio Gun . Industrial Engineering student, engineering change in the Atlanta Hawks warehouse September 2018 Macey Roache has been hired to work with the Atlanta Hawks as their Retail Warehouse\n                     Manager. As an IE student, Roache has actively engaged in providing designing and\n                     establishing process for the Hawks. Essentially, their warehouse had little to no\n                     known processes for receiving and distributing freight effectively. Roache has been\n                     tasked with taking a budget, analyzing that budget, and requesting materials to create\n                     the most efficient processes for the warehouse. Additionally, Roache handily handles hiring of key staff members - to build a team\n                     that will be able to sustain the ever-growing process the warehouse will endure during\n                     the Hawks\u2019 season. The warehouse has gone from an inventory amount of approximately\n                     1 million to almost 4 million. Roache has also used this degree plan to provide solutions\n                     for an offsite storage - for both overage and seasonal inventory. He has collaborated\n                     with an outside company to house inventory until they need it. Space is an issue,\n                     as with most sports organizations. Moreover, Roache was approved travel to another NBA organization in order to collect\n                     data from them, to bring back and implement throughout their new design process. Effectively\n                     creating and establishing partnerships across a larger spectrum of teams in the NBA.\n                     The visit was well received and they collected substantial data to help their process\n                     and thus drive sales. Roache said, \u201cKSU has been instrumental in establishing a solid educational foundation.\n                     My working experience has only gotten me so far. Without KSU I would NOT be able to\n                     handle the wonderful opportunity I\u2019ve been given in totality. Go Owls!!! (And Hawks).\u201d Civil Engineering student Awarded $5,000 Scholarship by New South Construction August 2018 Addie Thornton is working toward her Civil Engineering degree with a minor in Construction\n                     Management and certificate in Land Surveying.

Each term, Dr. Miles offers information sessions on subjects ranging from how to discover,\n                     select, and apply for scholarships, craft successful personal statements, structure\n                     a curriculum vitae, and tips on composing an academic portfolio. The sessions are\n                     open to the university public, and Honors students, in particular, are encouraged\n                     to attend.

As successful scholarship winners will attest, the process of composing a competitive\n                     application takes several months of thoughtful and active preparation. While the timetable\n                     of each scholarship as well as the particulars of each application will vary, students\n                     should identify the awards for which they plan to apply well in advance and schedule\n                     individual appointments with Dr. Miles (via email @  mmiles18@kennesaw.edu ) to discuss the particulars of their application process and to construct a personalized\n                     timeline to completion. As certain awards will require university nomination and/or\n                     endorsement and potentially include a campus interview, national deadlines are often\n                     preceded by internal ones.

Radow College of Humanities and Social Sciences", "body": "Norman J. Radow College of Humanities and Social Sciences Resources For \"To be grounded morally and ethically, to explore, and to come to understand our purpose\n                        as human beings is paramount to advancing our society, creating a better citizenry,\n                        and improving\u00a0the world in which we live.\u201d \u2013 Norman J. Radow, Founder and CEO of The RADCO Companies With his transformative $9 million gift in support of Kennesaw State University and\n                     the Norman J Radow College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Mr. Radow combines his\n                     20-year passion for KSU with his lifelong belief in the importance of expanding humanities\n                     and social sciences education in our country.\n                   A noted philanthropist, community champion, and respected business leader in commercial\n                     real estate, Radow\u2019s commitment to the humanities and social sciences began during\n                     his own time in college. He earned a B.A. degree in history, with minors in philosophy\n                     and communications at the State University of New York (SUNY) at Plattsburgh in 1978.\n                     \u201cAnyone can learn the technical aspects of business,\u201d Mr. Radow says. \u201cMy humanities\n                     degree gave me a thoughtful perspective of our world, helped me think critically,\n                     write well, and support positions and theories to my peers. This gave me the tools\n                     I needed to succeed \u2013 in law school, in business, and in life.\u201d\n                   Born in Brooklyn in 1957, Radow was raised in and around public housing projects and\n                     saw how poverty and segregation affected public policy. He decided that if he were\n                     ever able to do so, he would help families just like those with whom he grew up to\n                     live in safer communities that offered more opportunities.\n                   After graduating SUNY, Radow attended New York Law School and graduated in 1981. He\n                     made his first real estate deal in 1980, buying and selling a small building in Manhattan\n                     with a $10,000 loan from his family. The profits from this deal financed his last\n                     year of law school and set the trajectory for his entire career.\n                   Radow began working at the intersection of law, real estate, and government for New\n                     York City\u2019s Department of Housing Preservation and Development (HPD) where he litigated\n                     cases relating to tax-foreclosed housing mostly in Brooklyn. In 1987, he won a precedent-setting\n                     case in New York\u2019s First Appellate Department that invalidated the New York City tax\n                     foreclosure statute as unconstitutional. Soon after, Radow moved his family to Georgia,\n                     where he served as general counsel for an international real estate firm headquartered\n                     in Atlanta. He worked on transactions, litigated challenging cases, and handled the\n                     firm\u2019s restructuring during the savings and loans crises that nearly destroyed the\n                     real estate industry in the early 1990s.\n                   In one of those deals, Mr. Radow saw an opportunity to buy what is now the 53-story\n                     Four Seasons Hotel,\u00a0office, and condo tower in midtown Atlanta. Thus, the RADCO Companies\n                     were born, originally operating as a boutique firm doing developments as opportunities\n                     were presented. But in 2000, the investment bank Lehman Brothers called upon Radow\n                     to spearhead the rescue of an Atlanta property it intended to foreclose upon and reposition.\n                     RADCO earned a well-deserved reputation for resuscitating failing real estate developments\n                     across the country. In 2008, after Lehman Brothers failed, Radow took over the leadership\n                     of dozens of properties from the Lehman Estate in bankruptcy. The New York Times wrote\n                     extensively about his work in 2009.\n                   In 2011, Radow began to re-engage in the market as an investor and focused on workforce\n                     rental housing. He brought together nearly a billion dollars of private capital to\n                     acquire over 24,000 apartment units in less than a decade, built a tenant insurance\n                     business, and became a capital company supporting other developers, as well. RADCO\n                     was twice named the fastest growing company in Atlanta and Georgia, and Radow was\n                     named as one of Atlanta\u2019s most admired CEOs. Radow explained his passion for his work,\n                     \u201cI had the opportunity to do what I always said I would do: make sure working-class\n                     people could live in clean and safe communities they could both afford and be proud\n                     to call home.\u201d\n                   \n                      Norman J. Radow and his wife, Lindy, at Fifth Third Bank Stadium \n                      \n                   His many passions collided when he read an article in the newspaper that the local\n                     commuter college, Kennesaw State, tried and failed to create a partnership to build\n                     its first student housing in 1999. He wrote a letter to then Foundation chairman Michael\n                     Coles, offering his help. He has been a KSU Owl ever since. Radow later joined the\n                     board and worked with Coles and Atlanta businessman, Tommy Holder to lead the Foundation\n                     for 15 years, nearly doubling the footprint of the university through new student\n                     housing, classrooms, administrative and transportation infrastructure and sports facilities,\n                     that\n                   \u201cIt was a work of incredible passion,\u201d Radow says. \u201cThe three of us knew we had a\n                     diamond in the rough, and we could do more for the college, its students, the county,\n                     and our state here than anywhere else. That drove us to do incredible things.\u201d\n                   Radow applied his business acumen and love of building to Kennesaw State and put considerable\n                     resources into the support of scholarships to help students receive a world-class\n                     education, endowing the Paul Radow Scholars program in the engineering school to honor\n                     his father. When KSU President Pamela Whitten approached Radow and his wife, Lindy,\n                     for a major financial investment to fuel a new era of the university\u2019s growth, the\n                     Radow family met her challenge.\n                   In September of 2020, the University System of Georgia Board of Regents acknowledged\n                     Radow\u2019s leadership, his previous gifts to the University, and a new $9 million gift\n                     by unanimously approving the naming of the Norman J. Radow College of Humanities and\n                     Social Sciences.\n                   \u201cI wanted to be a catalyst for good in the world, a champion for humanities and social\n                     sciences education, and a business leader who set a standard of excellence, integrity,\n                     and philanthropy,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen people look at this exceptional college and ask\n                     who is Norman J. Radow, I hope that is what they will remember.\u201d\n                   \n                      Norman J.

Often, scholarship foundations\n                              are looking to diversify their student bodies, and as such, when an outstanding candidate\n                              applies from a university that has had few (or no) successful applicants (such as\n                              KSU), that student captures the attention of the scholarship committee(s). Since 2013,\n                              KSU has produced five Fulbright scholars and Gilman and Goldwater scholarship winners. Students are encouraged to make an appointment with Dr. Miles (preferably, by email\n                              at  mmiles18@kennesaw.edu ) to discuss their interest in applying for scholarships/fellowships. If the student\n                              has a good sense of his or her field, area of interest, etc., that\u2019s more than enough\n                              to begin! During your first meeting with Dr. Miles, students will discuss their talents,\n                              aspirations, etc. This information will be used to\u00a0determine\u00a0the best possible application\n                              fits. Dr. Miles also has some print materials that she is able to lend students that\n                              will allow for their extended perusal of available opportunities. In addition, Dr.\n                              Miles periodically offers university-wide workshops to anyone interested in learning\n                              more about scholarships and fellowships. \u00a0 Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

While class distinctions were\n                              the most evident foci engaged by the \"celebrated fathers of sociology,\" the work of\n                              sociologists like W.E. B. Dubois called upon the discipline to complicate discussions\n                              about social class differences by examining the dominance of structural barriers preventing\n                              individuals from attaining and living out the \"values\" of a society. DuBois helped\n                              to lay the foundation for exploring what it means to live in a society where race\n                              regulates social interactions and access to power. This talk will discuss the myriad\n                              ways social scientists have interrogated the intersectional spaces occupied by marginalized\n                              communities and how their contributions have created a vocabulary and advocacy agenda\n                              for social justice engagement.\n                            How to join :  Click here  and enter the passcode\u00a0 Diversity2 The  College of Humanities and Social Sciences \u00a0is hosting a series of events on diversity. As part of that series, we will be talking\n                              to Dr. Tracie Stewart, Professor of Psychological Science, about her research on unconscious\n                              bias in the workplace. The discussion will be featured as the November episode of\n                               Thought Provoking , the College of Humanities and Social Sciences podcast that focuses on faculty research.\n                            We\u2019ll learn how researchers like Dr. Stewart test what biases we may have \u2013\u00a0 and how\n                              they go about capturing biases we didn\u2019t even know we have. Can we actually rewire\n                              our brain to be less biased? We\u2019ll find out and we\u2019ll examine whether training or\n                              workplace policies can completely eliminate bias in the workplace, or can some policies\n                              actually make it worse? Finally, Dr. Stewart will tell us what\u00a0we\u00a0can do personally\n                              to help reduce bias at work.\n                            It will be released Nov. 17.

Founded in 1994, GATJ is a professional organization dedicated to providing the resources,\n                     support, and networking opportunities to ensure the promotion and quality delivery\n                     of Japanese language education and culture throughout the state. The organization\n                     comprises k-12 teachers, college instructors and faculty who are interested in promoting\n                     Japanese language education. The prestigious award is presented to one K-12 instructor\n                     and one college-level instructor annually. The awards were presented virtually this\n                     year during the annual Georgia Association of Teachers of Japanese meeting, which\n                     was sponsored by the Georgia Department of Education, the Japan-American Society of\n                     Georgia, and GATJ. Davis joined KSU in 2015 as a part-time instructor and in 2019 became full-time lecturer\n                     with the WLC department. She actively engages in developing programs such as a virtual\n                     exchange program in partnership with a university in Japan, as well as thoughtfully\n                     incorporating project-based learning into her courses. She serves as a Japanese Culture\n                     Club advisor and supports student leaders in coordinating live and virtual cultural\n                     events each month. Prior to joining KSU, Davis taught Japanese to high-school students on-line for four\n                     years for the Georgia Virtual School, as well as working for seven years as a translator\n                     and interpreter for a Georgia-based Japanese company. She subsequently went to work\n                     with Georgia Public Broadcasting\u2019s distance learning program, Irasshai, where she\n                     plays a role in the program creation on the curriculum development team, as well as\n                     training part-time instructors. Davis earned her master\u2019s degree in Foreign Language Education from the University\n                     of Georgia. While working toward her degree, she worked as a teaching assistant teaching\n                     Japanese. She has taught Japanese and Japanese culture at Elon University in North\n                     Carolina, as well as having taught English at Futaba High School in Fukushima, Japan. # # # Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

Radow College of Humanities and Social Sciences", "body": "Norman J. Radow College of Humanities and Social Sciences Resources For \n                        \t\t\t\t\t\tKENNESAW, Ga.\n                        \t\t\t\t\t\t(Aug 2, 2022)  \u2014 Kennesaw State University (KSU) associate professor of Interdisciplinary Studies Sara\n                     Giordano, Ph.D., with their co-investigator Angela Willey, Ph.D., of the University\n                     of Massachusetts (Amherst), have launched a biology education research project funded\n                     by a nearly $600K National Science Foundation (NSF) grant shared between the two universities.\n                     The research, being conducted in three phases over three years, examines how basic\n                     biological sciences are taught at the college level, and the context in which that\n                     body of knowledge has been created. Phase I, already underway, includes evaluating the most widely used introductory college-level\n                     biology textbooks nationwide. With the support of a research assistant, they also\n                     contacted every college biology instructor in Georgia to identify the most widely\n                     used textbooks and examine syllabi, and will do the same in Massachusetts, to identify\n                     potential geographical or regional differences in teaching materials. Phase II will\n                     examine biology education material from outside traditional biology resources to include\n                     work from feminist, Black, disability, and queer studies scholars, and environmental,\n                     reproductive justice, and healing justice activists. Finally, Phase III will focus\n                     on developing, testing, and deploying open-source teaching modules that offer a holistic\n                     approach to biology education and the biological sciences. Giordano expects an important\n                     outcome of the research will be codifying the research methodology so it may be applied\n                     to other fields of study. Asked what inspired this research focus, they explained that as a graduate student\n                     of neuroscience on track for their Ph.D., they understood scientific study to be an\n                     objective endeavor where students \u201cjust go and learn the truth.\u201d However, working\n                     with intersex, disability, and reproductive justice activists, Giordano realized that\n                     scientific study is siloed and although neuroscience is an interdisciplinary field,\n                     they said \u201cit is still only interdisciplinary within the maths and sciences.\u201d According\n                     to Giordano, this limited scope of biology misses the knowledge activists and scholars\n                     outside proper Biology have contributed. Giordano added that exposure to \u201cfeminist\n                     studies and from Black studies, reproductive justice movements, environmental justice\n                     movements, all of these things outside of the academy made me a stronger scientist\n                     inside the academy.\u201d This expanded view led them beyond neuroscience to consider the\n                     ethics, history, and philosophy of scientific study more broadly and to apply that\n                     wider, holistic framework as scientific research creates new knowledge. The concerns and insights of women, people of color, queer and gender non-conforming\n                     people, and people with disabilities have traditionally been marginalized in scientific\n                     research. \u201cWhat we [could] imagine about ourselves for the last 100 years\u2026has been\n                     about what we understand the possibilities of our biologies to be. \u2026You hear people\n                     say, well, this is human nature. This is not human nature. The debates are about whether\n                     something is natural or unnatural, whether something\u2019s possible or not misses the\n                     point that all knowledge is constructed in a particular time and place. Biology has\n                     a specific history and the very ideas of natural/unnatural were coproduced through\n                     colonization and the\u00a0development of capitalism,\u201d said Giordano. \u201cSo that means we\n                     do want to get voices that have been marginalized because we think that will change\n                     what truths we come up with.\u201d This research considers what knowledge about the biological counts as science and\n                     how that has shaped biology education. Giordano emphasized this research starts from\n                     a different perspective that is especially relevant today. This research begins by\n                     asking, \u201cwhat do we need and want to know about our bodies and environments? In this\n                     moment, I think it\u2019s particularly important [because] we\u2019re seeing huge issues and\n                     debates around the truth about science. I think giving folks skills and resources\n                     to adequately evaluate something like COVID-19 in a broader context is crucial. [For\n                     example,] no virus can be purely biological matter that exists outside of a historical,\n                     economic, and social context. Instead of looking at those as separate things, we add\n                     them together. It\u2019s about how we look at it holistically.\u201d One potential outcome that is of interest to NSF and other science institutions may\n                     be that approaching biology in this way could increase diversity in STEM by expanding\n                     the scope and breadth of biological science education. However, to Giordano and Willey,\n                     the larger goals have to do with redistributing epistemic authority and resources\n                     towards a more just world. They hope their work will be used by students inside and\n                     outside of traditional academic settings to gain more control over their lives. For\n                     example, feminist movements produced their own materials such as Our Bodies, Ourselves\n                     and the Black Panther Party deployed community sickle cell testing while challenging\n                     racist Biology studies about violence and race. \u201cSome of the most important work then\n                     is claiming space for \u2018alternative\u2019 knowledge and helping provide methodologies for\n                     others to truly participate in science,\u201d Giordano said. When the research concludes, Giordano and their co-PI, Angie Willey, expect to have\n                     created an open-source series of biology teaching modules that are accessible to educators\n                     and the public as a supplement to existing textbooks. Additionally, the methodology\n                     for developing these tools will be firmly established and applicable to other fields\n                     of study. Sara Giordano has spent more than a decade working in ethics, science education, and\n                     pedagogy after earning a Ph.D. in Neuroscience through the Graduate Division of Biological\n                     and Biomedical Sciences at Emory University. Through this work, Giordano developed\n                     models for interdisciplinary science education using critical science literacy in\n                     university classrooms, reported on\u00a0these experiments in a range of journals from fields\n                     such as science education, feminist studies, and science studies. Giordano\u2019s training\n                     and experience ensure the research team is well positioned to produce results that\n                     will broaden interdisciplinary biology education in a major way by targeting basic\u00a0biology\n                     education. Angie Willey, who earned her Ph.D. in Women\u2019s Studies from Emory University,\n                     has an expertise in queer feminist theory, settler colonial and postcolonial studies,\n                     and the history of gender, sexuality, and race in the biosciences. She has been actively\n                     developing curriculum that closes the gaps in biology and feminist and queer theory\n                     since 2013 and co-edited a book (Queer Feminist Science Studies: A Reader 2017), and\n                     double special issue of Catalyst: Feminist, Theory, Technoscience (Science Out of\n                     Feminist Theory Vols 1 & 2 2017), to bring the work of critical theorists engaged\n                     with science\u2019s abstract concepts and material objects into direct conversation. Giordano\n                     and Willey have collaborated for more than a decade on research and curriculum development.

After entering KSU as an undecided major, Alaina first explored English\n                     Education and Business Management before finding a major that she knew was perfect\n                     for her. Alaina claims that even as a child, she has always been interested in \u201cmaking\n                     a difference\u201d but it was her sociological training that solidified her decision to\n                     create positive social change. \u201cI\u2019ve always been social justice-oriented, very interested in marginalized groups\n                     and changing things and making a positive change. And so, I was like, \u201cYep, this is\n                     up my alley,\u201d explained Hoofnagle. During her time as a student at KSU, Hoofnagle held many titles, from an Honors College\n                     student to a teaching assistant to a research assistant. Her latest title comes with\n                     her most recent recognition as the 2022 Outstanding Scholar for Sociology at the All-College\n                     Awards. Making the most of her time at KSU, Hoofnagle worked with Dr. Evelina Sterling as\n                     a research assistant. The findings from Alaina\u2019s research suggested the addition of\n                     a COVID-19-centered curriculum to the self-management program, called \u201cHealthy Together.\u201d\n                     This NIH-funded research project allowed Alaina to explore her interests in medical\n                     sociology and create a difference in the African American community. She went on to\n                     present the findings of this research at the National Conference on Undergraduate\n                     Research and the Symposium of Student Scholars at KSU. After graduating in Spring 2022, Dr. Sterling offered Alaina a part-time position\n                     to continue her research at Kennesaw State. When asked about her plans after completing her research, Alaina emphasized her desire\n                     for a new career path that will allow her to continue to facilitate social change.\n                     \u201cI didn't discover medical sociology until very recently. I was seeking a high-impact\n                     career path that would enable me to create positive social change and then I discovered\n                     medical sociology.\u201d Alaina also recognized the misconception about getting a social sciences degree and\n                     highlighted the practical implications of switching her major. \u201cWhen people ask me what I major in, a lot of people think of psychology, and they\n                     asked me if I want to be a counselor. I think people just have that misunderstanding\n                     of what sociology is. However, when I started taking sociology classes, my perspective\n                     on the world changed. I've always been kind of socially conscious. But the sociological\n                     training that I got at KSU helps me to see the world through the sociological imagination,\n                     and I see almost everything with the sociological reason behind.\u201d Alaina says that she now has a very analytical approach to current events that she\n                     sees on the news daily. Overall, she believes that her undergraduate education and\n                     experience at KSU has made her a well-rounded person and citizen. \u201cRegardless of what you study, it shows that you were able to show up, have grit,\n                     complete what you're doing.\u201d Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

The Georgia\n                     Writers Association\u2019s (GWA) Georgia Author of the Year Awards (GAYA) is the longest-running\n                     literary award in the Southeastern United States said KSU\u2019s associate chair of the\n                     Department of English, Dr. Ralph Wilson. \u201cThe Department of English is very proud\n                     and happy to hear of Dr. Regina N. Bradley's latest accomplishment as a winner of\n                     the 58th Georgia Author of the Year Awards in the Essay Category,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cShe\n                     is an extremely talented writer, and the recognition is well deserved.\u201d John Havard, chair of the English Department said, \u201cDr. Bradley is among the most\n                     notable scholars in the new southern studies, doing work that deftly defies boundaries\n                     between literary and popular culture.\u201d \u00a0First presented in 1964, the awards celebrate\n                     \u201cthe best literature by Georgia writers.\u201d The Georgia Writers Association has managed\n                     the GAYA event since 1994. Held virtually in 2022, the event honored winners and finalists\n                     from 113 nominees in 14 categories. The awards presentation is available on  YouTube  and the  GWA website  in its entirety. \u201cAs an author with deep insight into Georgia culture, she is an\n                     ideal recipient for a Georgia Author of the Year Award. Dr. Bradley and her work represent\n                     some of the best the English Department has to offer: creativity, solid scholarship,\n                     and social and community engagement,\u201d Dr. Havard added. Literary judge Megan Volpert said of Bradley\u2019s essay, \u201cBradley is a defining voice\n                     of the new south\u2014an engrossing one that blends academic analytical chops with the\n                     personal narrative of lived experience as a Black woman who grew up after the civil\n                     rights movement. Her argument, that hip-hop culture since the Eighties represents\n                     concerns and methodologies of the next wave of contemporary southern Black identities,\n                     is clear and persuasive and without alternatives.\u201d \u00a0She went on to say, \u201cChronicling\n                     Stankonia begins with a close philosophical reading of Outkast and ends with an exhortation\n                     to invigorate cultural studies through attention to the popular arts and letters made\n                     by Black southerners.\u201d Regina N. Bradley is Associate Professor of English and African Diaspora Studies at\n                     Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, GA. Her research interests include southern\n                     hip hop, the contemporary Black American South, race and sound studies, and southern\n                     studies. Bradley\u2019s award-winning essay is based on her book of the same title published\n                     by the UNC Press. Dr. Bradley recently completed a semester as a Harvard Research\n                     Fellow in Spring 2022 and will be teaching at KSU in the fall.

Pack your bags and let\u2019s start planning. As I promised in my last note, we are ready to travel. We are heading to Italy! As many of you know, we had to cancel our previous Italy trip due to COVID-19 but now, borders are open and we can once again, start planning to tour Rome, Florence, Siena and Montepulciano, Italy. Montepulciano is Kennesaw State University\u2019s first permanent international education site, and it is located in a beautiful Renaissance town. It is known as the largest hill town in southern Tuscany, and we are happy to include this magnificent part of Italy to our travel trip. The trip will be led by Ken Hill, who is a KSU faculty member that lives in Montepulciano. He knows the ends and outs of Italy and will make sure that we do not miss any of the must-see areas of Italy but will also make sure that we see those special places only known to by the locals. Plan to join us for one of the two Information Sessions about this trip. The first session is scheduled for Wednesday, September 29th at 10:00am and the second on Wednesday, November 17th at 5:00pm.. Ken Hill will be joining us remotely for the first information session and has promised to let us peak outside his windows and see the beautiful surroundings of the city. Italy is on the top of my bucket list and I am counting the days until we embark on this adventure. If you love to travel as I do, we have all been waiting to be able to plan an international trip like this again. I am not stopping with this trip. I am already in the process of planning a second OLLI trip that we can all begin to enjoy together. One of the best things about traveling with OLLI is so many people travel alone, and this provides us with an opportunity to make new friends that share our same interests. Mark your calendars for one of the information sessions and we will review the itinerary, cost, trip dates and all the details. I will also ask your input about what other destinations that you would like to see us offer. Reservations are not required for these information sessions. Don\u2019t forget to review the catalog for new classes and a return of your favorites. You may notice that the Personal classes and the OLLI classes are not divided in the catalog. We felt it was easier to combine the classes and allow everyone to participate. Feel free to register for any of the classes that you see here in the catalog. You may also view the classes on the website at cpe. kennesaw.edu. Each person that is 50 years of age or older is eligible for two scholarships per fiscal year. You will find the scholarship information on the website too.

She learned about the  Phlebotomy  program by attending our  Open House  event in late 2014. \u201cI chose KSU because, in the community, KSU is known to be one of the best for medical programs. With a certificate from KSU, I felt confident that future employers would know that I had received proper education,\u201d she said. In the program, Breanna found the best way to learn a skill was to perform the skill on a regular basis, which was done in weekly labs on campus. The hands-on lab sessions were her favorite part. Although intimidating at first, the labs were the most helpful. \u201cIt also gave me the tools that I needed when applying for a position to let my interviewer know I had completed 50-plus successful sticks, versus someone who was new to phlebotomy and had not yet performed the skill,\u201d she said. Receiving her certification was a great accomplishment for Breanna. She worked hard to prove she had the knowledge needed to a get a job in the field. The test was not difficult for her because she felt prepared going into it. \u201cI knew that becoming nationally certified would be important when applying for a position. It shows your future employer that you went the extra mile and really know your stuff,\u201d Breanna said. In February 2015, she completed the program and applied to WellStar Cobb Hospital that same month. She was hired as a lab assistant and a phlebotomist in April 2015. During her training at Cobb, she was able to transition to microbiology and learn more about phlebotomy, blood cultures, fungus cultures and wound cultures among much more. \u201cI would have never had this opportunity without first receiving my Phlebotomy certification,\u201d she said. Later that year, she transferred to WellStar Paulding Hospital in Hiram to be closer to her home. Her job duties include preparing specimens for transport to reference labs, microbiology processing, specimen collection and preparing samples for technical staff. Before pursuing her certification in phlebotomy and working at WellStar, Breanna was a stay-at-home mother. She took college courses \u201chere and there\u201d over the past three years but wanted to pursue the healthcare field. She knew she needed to works night to avoid childcare and began looking into hospitals since they provided flexibility. \u201cI am now able to work at night, make my own schedule, and continue my education towards a nursing degree,\u201d Breanna said. For students joining the program or about to graduate, she had this to say: \u201cNot only can phlebotomy be a career but it can serve as diving board. I would highly recommend this program to others and would tell students about to graduate to be relentless; if you want a certain position go for it, go after it!\u201d Tag: health ,  phlebotomy technician ,  students Previous post Next post Kennesaw - KSU Center (470) 578-6765  \u00a9 2022 Kennesaw State University - Community and Professional Education", "emails": []},

In the event that a Kennesaw State University campus closure is implemented due to COVID-19, the College of Graduate and Professional Education (CGPE) courses will move forward as scheduled in a tech-enabled/online environment. If the coronavirus makes our building unavailable to students, it will not impact CGPE\u2019s commitment to education. The methods of instruction will shift, but the quality of instruction will be the same. Please refer all questions and concerns to your instructors and program managers. While we strive for accuracy, occasional changes and corrections do occur.\u00a0 Schedules, instructors and policies are subject to change. Our courses are designed for adult learners ages 18 and older. For those under 18 who wish to enroll in a class, a parent or guardian will be required to sign a waiver and receive staff approval prior to registering. The College of Professional Education follows the KSU Policy for anti-discrimination as follows: Kennesaw State University (KSU) is committed to maintaining a fair and respectful environment for living, work and study. To that end, and in accordance with federal and state law, Board of Regents policy, and University policy, the University prohibits harassment of or discrimination against any person because of race, color, sex (including sexual harassment and pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, ethnicity or national origin, religion, age, genetic information, disability, or veteran status by any member of the KSU Community on campus, in connection with a University program or activity, or in a manner that creates a hostile environment for members of the KSU community. Incidents of harassment and discrimination will be met with appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, expulsion, or termination from KSU. Every member of the KSU community is expected to uphold this policy as a matter of mutual respect and fundamental fairness in human relations. All members of the faculty, staff, and student body are expected to ensure that nondiscriminatory practices are followed at the University. In order to protect the privacy of learner records, the College of Professional Education follows the guidelines and provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974. In addition to FERPA guidelines, additional measures are taken to ensure that the privacy of learner records is maintained. Strict policies and procedures are in place concerning the privacy and release of learner records. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974, commonly referred to as the Buckley Amendment, protects the rights of students by controlling the creation, maintenance, and access to educational records. It guarantees students\u2019 access to their academic records while prohibiting unauthorized access by others. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) Documents: This series documents the process of student information release requests and consent authorizations or denials in accordance with FERPA. Records may include but are not limited to requests for formal hearings; requests for release of personally identifiable information; records of disclosures made to third parties; written consent of the student to disclose records; waivers for rights of access; and related documentation and correspondence. Release of Learner Records \u2013 All requests for learner records are to be requested in writing and require a signed release (waiver) from the student. This includes student requested transcripts and enrollment verifications. Third party requests for any student information and requests for student information over the phone will not be honored. If a third party requests information in person without the student being present, a signed waiver giving permission by the student must be presented. The signed waiver must state the institution, company or individual requesting the information. These requests may include verification of class attendance/participation, grades, enrollment, and other personal information. All request forms are located on our website under the registration tab. Release of Directory Information \u2013 Unless a student has signed a \u201cRelease of Directory Information\u201d form, we may disclose, without consent, \u201cdirectory\u201d information such as name, major, advisor, dates of attendance, degrees awarded, participation in recognized activities and sports, weight and height of athletic participants. Under the provisions of FERPA, the student has the right to withhold the disclosure of the above-mentioned categories of \u201cDirectory Information\u201d. The school has the obligation to inform the student, and if applicable the parent, that this form exists and must give a reasonable amount of time to request that the school not disclose information about them. In signing the form, the student must also be made aware that any future requests for such information from non-institutional persons or organizations will be refused, including emergencies. If you wish to change your \u201cRelease of Directory Information\u201d preferences, complete the provided\u00a0 Release of Directory Information \u00a0form. Students can submit completed forms by mail, email, fax, or in person. Please contact the Registration Department at 470-578-6765 if you have any questions concerning records privacy or release.

The treatment is directed towards children with behavioral problems,\n                              like those with ADHD, in order to help produce a positive behavior. BMOD is a beneficial\n                              evidence-based treatment because it reduces children's problematic behavior, like\n                              noncompliance, while reducing the need for high doses of ADHD medication. Behavior\n                              is modified by setting rules and expectations, and modify antecedents, which are events\n                              that occur before a specific behavior.\n                            This semester, we've received a grant to help students who parent at KSU. We've provided\n                              resources in the Cobb County and surrounding areas in the five areas of support: social\n                              capital, early childhood education, post-secondary and employment pathways, economic\n                              assets, and health and wellbeing. We've also provided them time management and self-care\n                              tips. Each session, we give the parents behavioral modification training. The student\n                              parents are all so eager about learning new ways to get their children to comply and\n                              behave. The student parents are always ready to share their experiences and tips as\n                              parents.\n                            The pandemic has made us adapt to online learning and has affected us all. We're prepared\n                              for next semester and any changes that may happen.\u00a0\n                            -Amanda Winkjer,\u00a0Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern\n                            During my time with the Children and Families Program (CFP), I was able to sit in\n                              on meetings with our community partners and community members. Through these avenues,\n                              we established relationships with other colleges, such as Georgia Northwest Technical\n                              College, who were also looking to create a Student-Parent Program, and were able to\n                              generate awareness of the services CFP offers amongst caretakers in Cobb County. These\n                              meetings have made me aware of the amount of time that must be dedicated to meetings\n                              with partners and stakeholders. However, this awareness gained through experience\n                              has only reaffirmed my interest in community collaboration as an aspect of my future\n                              career.\n                            We also worked with students who are parents during our six-week Student-Parent Program.\n                              We provided the parents with techniques \u2013 such as commands or planned ignoring \u2013 to\n                              assist them in managing their children\u2019s behavior and taught them how thoughts and\n                              feelings can influence behavior. It was encouraging to watch the parents develop greater\n                              understanding of the techniques and share their experiences implementing them.\n                            To assist the student-parents with other hardships they might face, we began to create\n                              a website toolkit containing five categories of resources: early childhood education,\n                              economic assets, physical health and wellbeing, postsecondary and employment programs,\n                              and social capital. Our efforts primarily focused on social capital and early childhood\n                              education; however, as these categories were what student-parents identified as their\n                              greatest needs. To me, this effort was wonderful because it was not only oriented\n                              toward those enrolled in the program but also comprehensive in its scope for when\n                              different needs might arise in the future. I am therefore sure that the student-parents\n                              will be grateful when they receive this toolkit.\n                            -Grace Bowe, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern\n                            These past few months as an intern for the Children and Family Programs at Kennesaw\n                              State University, I\u2019ve developed an understanding of all three main tenants of social-emotional\n                              learning and the basics of behavior modification. Before the program, I had little\n                              knowledge of behavior modification and the obstacles that student-parents go through\n                              daily. I had somewhat of an understanding that it was difficult, but wording it as\n                              difficult is not enough.\n                            In each session, parents were taught great methods that could help them have a better\n                              understanding of their child\u2019s emotions and set great relationships with them. The\n                              student-parent sessions where I got to understand their perspectives and learn more\n                              about parenting techniques along their side. It was so much fun participating in the\n                              student-parent sessions and getting to know some of them and their stories. Not only\n                              do I have this in mind for when I bear children, but I have it in mind for when I\n                              become an educator myself. I am always looking for future ideas and experiences that\n                              I can integrate into my future career, that is why I am so fortunate to be able to\n                              get the education from the program and learn so much.\n                            Although the spread of COVID has taken over the physical opportunities I could have\n                              gotten from experiencing this program in person, I still believe I got the best kind\n                              of training and comprehension of training. And there have been some ideas for the\n                              upcoming semester that I will be a part of. I was fortunate to sit in every meeting\n                              and get to know the wonderful, kind team. I also have participated in some grant meetings\n                              and writings. I am looking into continuing to gain more experience from such a helpful\n                              team.\n                            -Julissa Tello, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern\n                            I have learned so much over the past four months. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity\n                              to intern with Children and Family Programs. As a nontraditional student who is also\n                              a parent of college-aged children, I have especially enjoyed my experience working\n                              with the Student-Parent Ambassador program. I had attempted finishing my degree when\n                              my children were in elementary school, but decided to put it off once again as their\n                              activities became more of a priority than my own. If a support group for student parents\n                              was available at that time, I might have been more inclined to stick it out. Working\n                              with the student parents in the program was a beneficial way to see areas in which\n                              KSU could better meet the needs of its students. There is a great need for a childcare\n                              center on campus. If KSU were able to provide childcare then it would meet the needs\n                              of the student parents as well as provide an employment opportunity for the students\n                              who could potentially staff it. I also benefited from the behavior modification techniques\n                              and time management skills that Children and Family Programs provides to its student\n                              parents.\u00a0\n                            -Melissa Hooper, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern\n                            Overall, this program has been of great value to me personally and education wise.\n                              From this program, I gained a great amount of knowledge from the internship and sessions.\n                              One of the most impactful things I realized is how beneficial the resources and tools\n                              given at the Children and Family (CFP) program is to student-parents, and how crucial\n                              it is for them to have them.\n                            {CFP is} a program I never knew existed at Kennesaw State University (KSU) until I\n                              came across it from my internship advisor. They have valuable information for student-parents,\n                              but it's unfortunate many schools don\u2019t have a program like this one. This was of\n                              my importance to me, because often we see institutions/ universities don\u2019t have any\n                              resources or tools for their student-parents; they see them as just students. It made\n                              me realize how many student-parents are missing out on beneficial information for\n                              them as parents and students, and the importance of having a program like this.\n                            This program provides amplitude of resources and tools to help individuals succeed\n                              academically and as parents. Furthermore, I found these sessions helpful for the student-parents\n                              and myself. Each session was broken down and focused on one topic at time. I found\n                              creating a toolkit and resources for the student-parent of importance. Parents have\n                              all the information discussed in the sessions handy and can reference back to it as\n                              needed.\n                            -Midelvia Contreras, Fall 2020 Undergraduate Intern\n                            To learn more about the internship process,\u00a0please call (470) 578-2233 or email Dr.\n                        Allison Garefino at \u00a0 agarefin@kennesaw.edu Contact Info Kennesaw Campus 1000 Chastain Road Kennesaw, GA 30144 Marietta Campus 1100 South Marietta Pkwy Marietta, GA 30060 Campus Maps Phone 470-KSU-INFO (470-578-4636) kennesaw.edu/info Media Resources Resources For Related Links Follow KSU 470-KSU-INFO  (470-578-4636) \u00a9  2022 Kennesaw State University.

Eho is working in the exercise science laboratory of associate professor Katherine Ingram through the NIH\u2019s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney (NIDDK) diseases Short-Term Research Experience for Underrepresented Persons (STEP-UP) program, which offers summer research opportunities with a stipend. She is studying the effects of exercise and dietary changes on the hereditary nature of cardiometabolic conditions. \u201cThis is a great opportunity to be involved in research full time during the summer,\u201d the KSU senior said. \u201cOn top of the stipend that the  NIDDK STEP-UP  program offers, the most valuable part of the program is the mentorship that will be accessible to me, and the new knowledge that I will acquire from my mentors through this research experience.\u201d In December 2013, Eho and her family emigrated from the African nation of Togo. She\n                     graduated from Marietta High School, then earned an associate degree in interdisciplinary\n                     studies from Chattahoochee Technical College. She transferred to KSU for its  biochemistry  major, its emphasis on undergraduate research and its proximity to her home in Dallas. In fall 2020, Eho joined Ingram\u2019s lab, which focuses on the impact of gestational obesity and inactivity on maternal metabolic health. Through her research so far, Eho learned that these conditions often are passed down from generation to generation within families, and that people can manage their conditions with improved diet and regular exercise. \u201cThat is how my interest in exercise science started, because I wanted to know more about treatments that can help prevent hypertension, especially in young people,\u201d she said. Eho credited Ingram with encouraging her to seek out opportunities for enrichment,\n                     such as the NIDDK STEP-UP program. Ingram has personal experience with NIDDK, having\n                     served a post-doctoral fellowship at Alabama-Birmingham, and said she was happy to\n                     steer Eho toward the STEP-UP program. \u201cIt brings me great joy to see Ami flourish in this research environment,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cShe has presented her work at several conferences and is currently working on two papers that will be submitted for publication later this year. This NIDDK STEP-UP experience has given Ami an additional boost to her confidence level and to her career pursuits.\u201d Eho expects to graduate in spring 2022, after which she plans to attend medical school\n                     while pursuing a Ph.D. in biochemistry. She hopes to have a career as a pediatrician\n                     and researcher, helping young people with cardiometabolic conditions take charge of\n                     their health. \u2013 Dave Shelles Kennesaw State honors student researchers in annual Birla Carbon Scholars Symposium Kennesaw State researcher receives grant to study pollution effects in birds Kennesaw State adding program to diversify biomedical sciences A trio of Kennesaw State students spreads the gospel of ecology and conservation through engaging social media content A leader in innovative teaching and learning, Kennesaw State University offers undergraduate, graduate and doctoral degrees to its nearly 43,000 students.

When you are going through the Class Schedule Search\n                              you are probably seeing dozens of unique class offerings for ENGL 1101. As you are\n                              choosing the best day and time that works for you, make sure you are paying attention\n                              to the second set of numbers that follow \"ENGL 1101\". This is the \u00a0 Section Code , and can become very important as you are registering.\n                            The numbers and letters in bold refer to the \u00a0 Section Code :\n                            Some sections are open to all students, but others may be reserved for students in\n                              special populations. Those attempting to register for a special section that they\n                              were not accepted into will receive a registration error.\n                            CAMPUS RESTRICTION The Campus Restriction error will occur for Online Learner students or on-campus students\n                              trying to register for an \"Online Learner Only\" course. To resolve this error, students\n                              must register only for courses taught fully online (or not reserved for Online Learners).\n                              Example: An online learner attempting to register for a main campus course. Students\n                              who have signed up for an online learner program are not eligible to register for\n                              main campus courses.\n                            CLASS RESTRICTION The CLASS RESTRICTION error refers to a course that is restricted by student classification. To resolve this error, students must select a different course or seek override permission\n                              from the academic department offering the course. Example: KSU 1101 and KSU 2290 is\n                              restricted to freshman students.\n                            CLOSED SECTION The CLOSED SECTION error occurs when students attempt to register for a class that\n                              is full. To resolve this error, students should register for another section of the course\n                              or select a different course. If the course section offers a waitlist, consider waitlisting\n                              for the course. Closed course overrides are available only during the drop/add period. Students may\n                              inquire to the academic department and/or the college/school website responsible for\n                              the course that is closed. If approved, the department will enter the approval code\n                              in the Student Information System. The student must then register for the course.\n                            CONNECTED COURSE DROP CONFIRMATION The Connected Course Drop Confirmation notice will appear when students attempt to\n                              drop a course that has a connected or linked course, i.e., co-requisite or concurrent\n                              prerequisite course. Drop both courses by clicking the DROP button on this page.\n                            CORQ_Course XXXX REQ The CORQ (Co-requisite) error occurs when students do not register for a group of\n                              courses that are linked together. To resolve this error, students must register for\n                              all co-requisite courses (CRNs) at the same time. Example: This registration error\n                              will most likely occur when Freshmen are attempting to register for courses within\n                              a Learning Community. Students must register for all Learning Community courses (CRNs)\n                              at the same time. \u00a0 Important Notes: When registering for a science course that requires a lab, both the\n                                 lecture and lab courses must be registered for successfully at the same time. You will receive a course\n                                 PREQ & TEST SCORE or CORQ Course XXXX REQ ERROR until registration for both courses\n                                 (lecture and lab) are successful. CRN DOES NOT EXIST ##### The CRN DOES NOT EXIST error occurs as a result of not using the correct CRN for a\n                              specific semester. To resolve this error, either enter in the correct CRN grouping\n                              (as indicated below) or select a different term. Semester CRN\n                            DEPARTMENTAL APPROVAL The DEPARTMENTAL APPROVAL error occurs when students attempt to register for courses\n                              that are reserved for specific groups of students. To resolve this error, students\n                              will need to contact the academic department teaching the course in order to obtain\n                              permission to enroll into this course. Once permitted, the student must login to Owl\n                              Express and register.\n                            DUPL CRSE WITH SEC-XXXXX The DUPL CRSE, Duplicate Course, error occurs when students attempt to register for\n                              the same subject and course number twice. Students needing to register for more than\n                              one special topics course may contact the academic department of the discipline for\n                              assistance with a repeat override. LEVEL RESTRICTION The LEVEL RESTRICTION error occurs when undergraduate students attempt to register\n                              for graduate level courses. To resolve this error, students should only select undergraduate\n                              level courses.\n                            MAJOR RESTRICTION The MAJOR RESTRICTION error occurs when students attempt to register for courses that\n                              are reserved for a specific degree/major or groups of majors. To resolve this error,\n                              students should register for another course or seek override permission from the academic\n                              department offering the course.\n                            MAXIMUM HOURS EXCEEDED Maximum Course Load - During the Fall and Spring semesters, a student may register\n                              for up to 18 hours. The Registrar may approve up to 21 hours for students with an\n                              institutional GPA of 3.5 or higher. Course loads above 21 hours must also have a recommendation\n                              from the student\u2019s department chair. During the Summer term, a student may register\n                              for up to 13 hours. The Registrar may approve up to 15 hours for students with an\n                              institutional GPA of 3.5 or higher. Students not in good academic standing will be\n                              limited to 13 hours during any term. Course loads above 13 hours must have a recommendation from an academic advisor\n                              or department chair that is made to the Registrar.\n                            MUTUAL EXCLUSIVE The MUTUAL EXCLUSION with MATH XXXX error occurs when a student who has previously\n                              enrolled or received credit for MATH 1111 or 1112 attempts to register for MATH 1113\n                              and vis versa. Questions may be addresses with the Mathematics department.\n                            PREQ & TEST SCORE-ERROR The PREQ & TEST SCORE-ERROR occurs when students attempt to register for courses in\n                              which they do not meet the course prerequisites. Course prerequisites are checked\n                              during the registration process. To resolve this error, students should register for\n                              a different course in which they meet course prerequisites. A list of course prerequisites\n                              can be found by returning to the Registration Worksheet and clicking on Class Search\n                              at the bottom of the page. Click on the CRN and then on the Course Title. The course\n                              prerequisites are listed at the bottom of the page. Labs and Lectures: When registering\n                              for a science course that requires a lab, both the lecture and lab courses must be\n                              registered for successfully at the same time. You will receive a course PREQ & TEST\n                              SCORE or CORQ Course XXXX REQ ERROR until registration for both courses (lecture and\n                              lab) are successful. Concurrent Prerequistes: a set of courses that must be taken\n                              simultaneously.\n                            REPEAT COUNT EXCEEDS 1 The REPEAT COUNT EXCEEDS 1 error occurs when a student has exceeded the number of\n                              attempts allowed to repeat a course. Effective spring 2012, a student may repeat a\n                              course once. Receiving this error means that the student has exceeded the attempts\n                              more than one additional time. To resolve this error, the student may consult the\n                              academic department of that discipline to be considered for an override.\n                            STUDENT ATTRIBUTE Reserved for students in a particular cohort. Examples are \u00a0 Honors College (H sections) , \u00a0 Advanced Major Program (M sections) , \u00a0 New Students at Orientation (N sections) . N courses sections will open to the general population after the last orientation\n                              session.\n                            TIME CONFLICT WITH XXXXX The TIME CONFLICT error occurs when students attempt to register for courses that\n                              conflict or overlap by date and time. To resolve this error, students should register\n                              for courses on a different date and time.\n                            To access an easy-to-view summary of your current registration, visit \u00a0 Owl Express \u00a0 then follow these instructions:\n                            If a class you thought you signed up for is not listed here, it means you are currently\n                                 not registered or waitlisted for it. Go back to the Class Registration page and try\n                                 again while paying close attention to any registration errors or waitlist prompts. DegreeWorks will automatically update as you register for classes. Courses that are\n                              satisfying an area of your degree will appear in blue. Courses that are not counting\n                              towards the degree you have declared will populate under \"Unused Courses\" at the bottom\n                              on the page.\n                            Recently submitted a major change? If you have entered in a major change that has not yet updated on your transcript,\n                              you can still check to see if the courses you registered for will count towards your\n                              new major by clicking on \"What-If\" in the left-hand menu.\n                            When you applied to KSU, you were placed into your starting MATH course based on a combination of your high school GPA and the math portion of your SAT or ACT, whichever you took or whichever was higher.\n                            Please ensure that you register for the appropriate math class for your major. This\n                              is not the only way that you can get into a specific Math course. You might have a college\n                              credit from dual enrollment or AP scores.

This is an \u00a0 intensive \u00a0 combination at-home module/proctored exam.\n                            Generally we advise students who are awaiting AP scores to register based on possibly\n                              not receiving credit for any exams, and then making necessary adjustments to their\n                              schedule later in the Summer.\n                            Students can also choose to register for other courses that are not dependent on their\n                              scores. For example, if a student believes they may be getting credit for ENGL 1101,\n                              they may register for a different general education class like POLS 1101 until ther\n                              scores come in. At that point, if they did get credit for ENGL 1101 they could drop\n                              POLS 1101 and register for ENGL 1102 in its place.\n                            Regardless, be sure you have requested your scores be sent to KSU from College Board.\n                              KSU will not award any credit otherwise.\n                            \u00a0 Get ahead on your math and science courses!\u00a0 The sooner you complete these courses\n                     the better. Not taking sciences could potentially hinder progression once a student\n                     is officially enrolled at KSU.\u00a0 Taking all of your general education courses prior\n                     to KSU can also impact your ability to be full-time once you become a KSU student.\u00a0\n                   Be sure to check the specific program requirements for your intended major by visiting\n                     our website.

(Nov 9, 2021)  \u2014 Kennesaw State University researchers have earned a $1 million federal grant to\n                     train students to provide suicide and drug abuse prevention services among youth in\n                     five counties across rural northwest Georgia.\n                   Professor emerita of social work Irene McClatchey, professor of social work Monica\n                     Nandan, and  two other co-investigators will use the four-year grant to prepare 74 behavioral\n                     health paraprofessionals to work in rural areas. The ultimate goal of the project\n                     is to prevent suicide and non-prescribed drug use among marginalized youth by increasing\n                     the number of behavioral health professionals particularly in Bartow, Floyd, Gordon,\n                     Paulding and Polk counties. The grant is the first of its kind at KSU from the Health\n                     Resources and Services Administration, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health\n                     and Human Services.\n                   \u201cThere is a shortage of behavioral health workers in rural Georgia,\u201d said Nandan,\n                     who also serves as Director of Strategic Partnerships and Social Impact in the Wellstar\n                     College. \u201cAs we conduct research, engage communities and offer courses, we hope to\n                     improve lifestyle outcomes in these areas.

(Oct 15, 2021) \u00a0 \u2014 Two Kennesaw State University researchers in the  Wellstar College of Health and Human Services \u00a0 have created a novel approach that may help slow the progression of Type 2 diabetes\n                     with just 40 minutes a week of exercise.\n                   Brian Kliszczewicz, associate professor of \u00a0 exercise science , and Robert Buresh, professor ofexercise science, have received a three-year, $380,000\n                     grant from the \u00a0 National Institutes of Health \u00a0 to study the effectiveness of a novel high-intensity bodyweight circuit training regimen\n                     that offers a more time-conscious path to treat and manage Type 2 diabetes.\n                   Conventional guidelines call for 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise a week to\n                        maintain a healthy lifestyle, but Kliszczewicz said this time commitment often deters\n                        many people from engaging in exercise. He and Buresh devised this circuit to cut down\n                        the time required, make exercise more accessible to those who might benefit from it,\n                        and ultimately help prevent the advancement of Type 2 diabetes.
